'''Junqueirópolis''' is the name of a [[city]] and the surrounding municipality in the western region of the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The population is 20,066 (2015 est.) in an area of 583&amp;nbsp;km²&lt;ref&gt;[http://cod.ibge.gov.br/54L Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]&lt;/ref&gt; (5&amp;nbsp;km² of which is city). Its elevation is 421 m. ''[[Do Peixe River (Paraná River)|Rio do Peixe]]'' (Fish River) and ''[[Aguapeí River (São Paulo)|Rio Aguapeí]]'' (Aguapeí River) are major [[river]]s of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmj&quot;&gt;[http://www.junqueiropolis.sp.gov.br/] Prefeitura Municipal de Junqueirópolis (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;geo&quot;&gt;[http://www.junqueiropolis.sp.gov.br/aspectosgeograficos.php] Aspectos Geográficos de Junqueirópolis (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality contains 16.5% of the {{convert|9044|ha}} [[Aguapeí State Park]], created in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|PES do Aguapeí – ISA}}|language=pt

==History==
At the start of the 20th century this area was largely unexplored and undeveloped.  It was not until 1941 that the ''Companhia Paulista de Estrada de Ferro'' (São Paulo Locomotive Company) ran [[railroad tracks]] through this remote [[hinterland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;his&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.junqueiropolis.sp.gov.br/historia.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121130041022/http://www.junqueiropolis.sp.gov.br/historia.php |archivedate=2012-11-30 }} História de Junqueirópolis (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years Alvaro de Oliveira Junqueira, a wealthy inhabitant of the city of [[São Paulo]], began buying up land here upon which he established [[coffee]] [[plantation]]s.  On 1 November 1944 the municipal division of ''Patrimônio de Junqueira'' (Junqueira's [[Property|Patrimony]]) was established and [[land development]] proceeded as lots were sold to investors. &lt;ref name=&quot;his&quot;/&gt;

Horácio Cajado de Oliveira, Enrique Coutinho and Jose Amatruda were among those that settled here during this period.  Another early settler was Torataro Takitami, a representative of the country's growing [[Japanese Brazilian]] population.&lt;ref name=&quot;his&quot;/&gt;

Junqueirópolis was officially founded on 14 June 1949.  The [[place name]] has been formed by joining Junqueira's [[surname]] with the [[Greek language]]-derived [[suffix]] ''-[[polis]]'' meaning &quot;city&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmj&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;his&quot;/&gt;

==Agriculture==
[[Image:Malpighia glabra.jpg|thumb|222px|right|This is the [[Vitamin C]] rich [[fruit]] for which Junqueirópolis has been nicknamed ''Capital da [[Acerola]]'', the &quot;Acerola Capital&quot;.]]
Outside the urban area, Junqueirópolis is a hilly,  [[agriculture|agricultural]] region that produces valuable [[crop]]s that thrive in a [[subtropical]] [[climate]].  For this reason the municipality promotes itself as ''Cidade Verde'', &quot;Green City&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmj&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;his&quot;/&gt;

Among the [[fruit]]s grown here, [[acerola]] is important enough to the local economy that Junqueirópolis has another [[nickname]] -- ''Capital da Acerola'', the &quot;Acerola Capital&quot;.  In the 1998–1999 season Junqueirópolis produced 2,450 tons of this fruit.  The predominant type of acerola produced here is the &quot;Olivier&quot;, a variety that is packed with the [[Vitamin C]] (1.200&amp;nbsp;mg/100ml of juice and 1.400&amp;nbsp;mg/100g of pulp) for which this plant is primarily cultivated and can be cultivated with little [[pesticide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmj&quot;/&gt;

Junqueirópolis is also known for its [[grape]]s.  Among the most widely cultivated varieties of grape in Junqueirópolis are Itália, Benitaka, Brazil and Ruby.  Grapes from this region are made into [[table wine]]s of excellent quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmj&quot;/&gt;

Other major crops grown in Junqueirópolis are [[maize]], [[cotton]], and coffee.  The importance of produce production to this region is demonstrated in the depiction of the municipal [[coat of arms]] shown above which has been illustrated with acerola, grapes, [[sugarcane]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmj&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[heraldry|heraldic]] terms, the produce shown in this depiction of Junqueirópolis' municipal coat of arms does not form an actual component of the [[armorial achievement]] and is considered mere extraneous decoration&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penitentiary==
The penitentiary in Junqueirópolis was the site of some of the [[2006 São Paulo violence|violence of 2006]] that swept the prisons of São Paulo state and involved deadly clashes between [[Primeiro Comando da Capital]] (a [[prison gang]]) and [[Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo]] (the [[Polícia Militar|state police]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003012520_brazil23.html] ''[[Seattle Times]]'', &quot;Jails can't contain Brazil's gangs&quot;, Tuesday, May 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
