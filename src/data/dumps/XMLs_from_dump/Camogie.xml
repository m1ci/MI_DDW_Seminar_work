'''Camogie''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑː|m|ɔː|g|iː}}; {{lang-ga|camógaíocht}}) is an Irish stick-and-ball team sport played by women. Camogie is played by 100,000 women in [[Ireland]] and worldwide, largely among Irish communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moran 2011 460&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Moran | first = Mary | authorlink = Mary Moran (camogie) | title = A Game of Our Own: The History of Camogie | publisher = Cumann Camógaíochta | year = 2011 | location = Dublin, Ireland | pages = 460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A variant of the game of [[hurling]] (which is played by men only) adapted to suit women, it is organised by the Dublin-based [[Camogie Association]] or [[Camogie Association|An Cumann Camógaíochta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camogie.ie/about-camogie.asp|title=The Camogie Association : About Camogie|last=Vuepoint.ie|website=Camogie.ie|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/my-gaa/getting-involved/camogie|title=GAA.ie|website=Gaa.ie|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] lists Camogie as an element of [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/hurling-01263|title=Hurling - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The game==
[[File:Scoring in Gaelic games - H shaped posts.png|thumb|Goalposts and scoring system used in camogie]]
The game consists of two thirty-minute halves. There is a half-time interval of 10 minutes. In event of extra time, halves must consist of 10 minutes each. Each team has 15 players on the field. Within the 15 players the team must consist of one goalkeeper, three full back players, three half back players, two centre-field players, three half forward players and three full forward players. There is a minimum requirement of 12 players on the pitch at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camogie.ie/files/Administration+Section/Playing+Rules+2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116004430/http://www.camogie.ie/files/Administration+Section/Playing+Rules+2014.pdf |archivedate=16 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field===
The field is not of a fixed size, but must be between 130m long by 80m wide, and 145m long by 90m wide.

===Goals and scoring===
{{Main|Scoring in Gaelic games}}
H-shaped goals are used. A team achieves a score by making the ball go between the posts. If the ball goes over the bar for a &quot;point&quot;, the team earns one point. If the ball goes under the bar for a &quot;goal&quot;, the team earns three points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camogie.ie/AboutCamogie/CamogiePlayingRules/tabid/59/Default.aspx|title=Rules of Camogie on Camogie.ie website|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile of camogie==

==Rules==
The rules are almost identical to [[hurling]], with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camogie.ie/AboutCamogie/CamogievHurlingRuleDifferences/tabid/60/Default.aspx|title=Rule Differences on Camogie.ie website|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players. This is because no special rules apply to the goalkeeper and so there is no need for officials to differentiate between goalkeeper and outfielders.
*A camogie player can handpass any  score from play ''(handpassing a goal is forbidden in hurling since 1980)''.
*Camogie games last 60 minutes, two 30-minute halves ''(senior inter-county hurling games last 70, which is two 35-minute halves)''. Ties are resolved by multiple 2×10-minute [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] extra time periods; in these, the first team to score wins.
*Dropping the [[camogie stick]] to handpass the ball is permitted.
*A smaller sliotar (ball) is used in camogie – commonly known as a size 4 sliotar – whereas hurlers play with a size 5 sliotar.
*If a defending player hits the sliotar wide, a 45-metre puck is awarded to the opposition ''(in hurling, it is a 65-metre puck)''.
*After a score, the goalkeeper pucks out from the 13-metre line ''(in hurling, he must puck from the end line)''.
*The metal band on the camogie stick must be covered with tape ''(not necessary in hurling)''.
*Side-to-side charges are forbidden ''(permitted in hurling)''.
*Two points are awarded for a score direct from a sideline cut (since March 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/ladies-sticking-with-skirts-as-oflynn-backs-rules-makeover-3066426.html|title=Ladies sticking with skirts as O'Flynn backs rules makeover - Independent.ie|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Camogie players must wear [[skirt]]s or [[skort]]s rather than [[shorts]].

==Foundation==
Experimental rules were drawn up in 1903 for a female stick-and-ball game by [[Máire Ní Chinnéide]], [[Seán (Sceilg) Ó Ceallaigh]], [[Tadhg Ó Donnchadha]] and [[Séamus Ó Braonáin]]. The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Chéitinnigh (Keatings branch of the [[Gaelic League]]) and [[Cúchulainns]] on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport's governing body, the Camogie Association or [[Camogie Association of Ireland|An Cumann Camógaíochta]] was founded in 1905 and re-constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939. Until June 2010 it was known as Cumann Camógaíochta na nGael.

Máire Ní Chinnéide and Cáit Ní Dhonnchadha, two prominent Irish-language enthusiasts and cultural nationalists, were credited with having created the sport, with the assistance of Ní Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother Tadhg Ó Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de siècle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;Ríona Nic Congáil “'Looking on for centuries from the side-line': Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie&quot;, Éire-Ireland (Spring / Summer 2013): 168–192.[https://www.academia.edu/3324668/Looking_on_for_centuries_from_the_side-line_Gaelic_Feminism_and_the_rise_of_Camogie Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camogie Team, Waterford, 17 October 1915.jpg|thumb|A camogie team pictured in Waterford in October 1915]]

==Historic rules==
Under [[Séamus Ó Braonáin]]'s original 1903 camogie rules both the match and the field were shorter than their hurling equivalents. Matches were 40 minutes, increased to 50 minutes in 1934, and playing fields 125–130 yards (114-119m) long and 65–70 yards (59-64m) wide. From 1929 until 1979 a second crossbar, a &quot;points bar&quot; was also used, meaning that a point would not be allowed if it travelled over this bar, a somewhat contentious rule through the 75 years it was in use. Teams were regulated at 12 a side, using an elliptical formation, although it was more a &quot;squeezed lemon&quot; formation with the three midfield players grouped more closely together than their counterpart on the half back and half-forward lines. In 1999 camogie moved to the GAA field-size and 15-a-side, adopting the standard GAA butterfly formation.

==Nomenclature==
The name was invented by [[Tadhg Ó Donnchadha|Tadhg Ua Donnchadha]] (Tórna) at meetings in 1903 in advance of the first matches in 1904.

Men play using a curved stick called in Irish a ''camán''. Women would use a shorter stick, at one stage described by the diminutive form ''camóg''. The suffix -''aíocht'' (originally &quot;uidheacht&quot;) was added to both words to give names for the sports: ''camánaíocht'' (which became ''iománaíocht'') and ''camógaíocht''. When the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] was founded in 1884 the English-origin name &quot;hurling&quot; was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to anglicise the Irish name ''camógaíocht'' to ''camogie''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moran 2011 460&quot;/&gt;

==Structure==
[[Camogie Association|An Cumann Camógaíochta]] has a similar structure to the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], with an Annual Congress every spring which decides on policy and major issues such as rule changes, and an executive council, the Árd Chómhairle which deals with short-term issues and governance. The game is administered from a headquarters in [[Croke Park]] in Dublin. Each of 28 [[Gaelic Athletic Association county|county board]]s takes control of its own affairs (all of the Irish counties except [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]], [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] and [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]]), with the number of clubs ranging from 58 in [[Cork GAA|Cork]] to one in [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]]. There are four provincial councils and affiliates in [[Asia GAA|Asia]], [[Australia GAA|Australia]], [[Britain GAA|Britain]], [[Europe GAA|Europe]], [[New York GAA|New York]], [[New Zealand GAA|New Zealand]] and [[North American GAA|North America]].

==Camogie clubs==
There are 537 camogie clubs, of which 513 (95.5%) are based on the island of Ireland, 47 in [[Connacht GAA#Camogie|Connacht]] (8.8%), 195 in [[Leinster GAA#Camogie|Leinster]] (36.4%), 160 in [[Munster GAA#Camogie|Munster]] (29.8%), and 110 in [[Ulster GAA#Camogie|Ulster]] (20.5%).

The [[Gael Linn Cup]] is an inter-provincial competition played at senior and junior level. The sport is closely associated with the [[Celtic Congress]]. Two former [[Camogie Association]] presidents [[Máire Ní Chinnéide]] and [[Agnes O'Farrelly]] were also presidents of [[Celtic Congress]] and exhibition matches have been held at the Celtic Congress since 1938. The first such exhibition match, on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1938, marked the first appearance of [[Kathleen Cody (athlete)|Kathleen Cody]], who became one of the stars of the 1940s.

===Inter-collegiate===
The [[Ashbourne Cup|Ashbourne]] and Purcell Cups and Father Meachair seven-a-side are the principal inter-collegiate competitions.
