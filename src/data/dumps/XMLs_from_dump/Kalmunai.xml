'''Kalmunai''' ({{lang-ta|கல்முனை|translit=Kalmuṉai}}; {{lang-si|කල්මුනේ|translit=Kalmunē}})  is the largest city of [[Ampara District]]. It is also the largest city of [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka]]. It had a total population of 106,780 as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypopulation.de/SriLanka.html Sri Lanka census]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few Muslim-majority municipalities in the country.  When Muslims in Colombo were expelled by Portuguese in the 17th century, they fled to Kandy and sought refuge with [[King of Kandy|King]] [[Rajasinha II of Kandy|Rajasinha II]], who resettled these refugees in Kalmunai (8,000 refugees) and [[Kattankudy]] (4,000).  Kalmunai was the site of the royal farm, as a result of this settlement, it became a Muslim-majority area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knox|first=Robert|title=An Historical Relation of the Island of Ceylon|year=1681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were [[Sri Lankan Muslims]], [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], and [[Burgher people|Burghers]] with the [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moors]] forming a majority. It consists of four major regions namely Kalmunai city (Thalavatuvan Junction to Zahira College Road), Kalmunai North (Pandiruppu, [[Maruthamunai]], and Neelavanai), Kalmunai South ([[Sainthamaruthu]]) and Kalmunai West (Natpittimunai, Chenaikudiruppu).

The devastating [[Sri Lankan civil war]] has adversely affected the area with number a [[forced disappearance]]s, and civil unrest targeting the local civilians. It was also directly impacted by the [[2004 Tsunami]], leading to number of deaths and destruction of property worth of millions of rupees. It is bounded on the east by the [[Indian Ocean]] on the north by the Periyaneelavanai village and on the south by Karaitivu village which is considered to be a suburb of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uthr.org/Reports/Report5/chapter9.htm UTHR report on Kalmunai] [[UTHR]] (English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/5464274/Kalmunai Wiki-map Kalmunai]&lt;/ref&gt;
