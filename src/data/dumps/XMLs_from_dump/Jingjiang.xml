'''Jingjiang''' ({{zh|c=靖江|p=Jìngjiāng}}) is a [[county-level city]] under the administration of [[Taizhou, Jiangsu|Taizhou]], [[Jiangsu]] province, China. It is located on the northern (left) bank of the [[Yangtze River]], and is the southernmost part of Taizhou City, bordering [[Nantong]] to the northeast, [[Suzhou]] to the southeast, [[Wuxi]] to the south, [[Changzhou]] to the southwest, and [[Zhenjiang]] to the west. The area of Jingjiang is 655.6 square kilometres and the population was 684,360 at the 2010 census. 

== History ==
The terrain of Jingjiang nowadays was originated as a shoal in the Yangtze River, which was known '''Matuosha''' in the ancient China. As the shoal had been extended, it was separated from then [[Jiangyin]] county to found a new county in 1471. As being looted by the [[Wokou]] for several time, it is designated '''Jiangjiang''' (means &quot;pacifying the Yangzte River&quot;). &lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|script-title=zh:中国历史大辞典·历史地理卷|last=|first=|publisher=Shanghai Cishu Press|year=1996|isbn=7-5326-0299-0|volume=|location=|pages=955|language=zh|trans-title=The Great Encyclopaedia of Chinese history, Volume on Historical Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Yangzhou originally, was converted to a county-level city in 1993, then was transferred to the Taizhou in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|script-title=zh:江苏市县概况|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-7-55-373496-5|location=|pages=398–401|language=zh|trans-title=A Survey of Cities and Counties in Jiangsu|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
