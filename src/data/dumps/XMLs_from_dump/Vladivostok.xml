'''Vladivostok''' ({{lang-rus|Владивосто́к|a=Владивосток.ogg|p=vlədʲɪvɐˈstok}}, literally 'ruler of the east') is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative centre]] of the [[Far Eastern Federal District]] and [[Primorsky Krai]], [[Russia]], located around the [[Zolotoy Rog|Golden Horn Bay]], not far from Russia's borders with [[China]] and [[North Korea]].

''Vladivostok'' was first named in 1859 along with other features in the [[Peter the Great Gulf]] area by [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]].  The name first applied to the bay but, following an expedition by [[Alexey Shefner]] in 1860, was applied to the new settlement.&lt;ref&gt;В. В. Постников. (V. V. Postinkov.)

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the place where the city is situated nowadays has been known since the [[Qing dynasty]] as '''Haishenwai''' ({{lang|zh|海參崴}}, ''Hǎishēnwǎi''), from the [[Manchu language|Manchu]] ''Haišenwai'' ({{Lang-mnc|m=ᡥᠠᡳᡧᡝᠨᠸᡝᡳ|v=Haišenwai|a=Haixenwai|links=no}}) or &quot;small seaside village&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;“海参崴来自满语，意为‘海边的小渔村’”：{{cite web|last1=阳|first1=曹|title=冰雪黑龙江 圣诞异国游--频道风采|url=http://www.radiotj.com/pdfc/system/2009/12/03/000216884.shtml|website=天津广播网|publisher=天津人民广播电台交通广播|accessdate=9 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910174047/http://www.radiotj.com/pdfc/system/2009/12/03/000216884.shtml|archive-date=September 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern-day [[China]], Vladivostok is officially known by the transliteration {{lang|zh|{{linktext|符拉迪沃斯托克}}}} (''Fúlādíwòsītuōkè''), although the historical Chinese name {{lang|zh|{{linktext|海参崴}}}} (''Hǎishēnwǎi'') is still often used in common parlance and outside mainland China to refer to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novostivl.ru/msg/11052.htm &quot;Владивосток все же стал Хайшенвеем&quot;.] Novostivl.ru. 7 May 2010.

==History==
{{Main|History of Vladivostok|Timeline of Vladivostok}}

The aboriginals of the territory on which modern Vladivostok is located are the [[Udege people|Udege]] minority, and a sub-minority called the [[Taz people|Taz]] which emerged through members of the indigenous Udege mixing with the nearby Chinese and [[Hezhe]]. The region had been part of many states, such as the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], [[Balhae Kingdom]], [[Liao Dynasty]], [[Jīn Dynasty]], [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Qing Dynasty]] and various other Chinese dynasties, before Russia acquired the entire Maritime Province and the island of Sakhalin by the [[Treaty of Beijing]] (1860). [[Qing China]], which had just lost the [[Opium War]] with Britain, was unable to defend the region. The [[Manchu people|Manchu]] emperors of China, the Qing Dynasty, banned Han Chinese from most of [[Manchuria]] including the Vladivostok area (see [[Willow Palisade]])—it was only visited by illegal gatherers of ginseng and sea cucumbers.

On 20 June 1860 (2 July for [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian style]]), the military supply ship ''[[Manchur]]'', under the command of Captain-Lieutenant [[Alexey Shefner|Alexey K. Shefner]], called at the Golden Horn Bay to found an outpost called Vladivostok. [[Warrant officer]] [[Nikolay Vasilyevich Komarov|Nikolay Komarov]] with 28 soldiers and two non-commissioned officers under his command were brought from [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur]] by ship to construct the first buildings of the future city.

The [[Manza War]] in 1868 was the first attempt by Russia to expel Chinese from territory it controlled. Hostilities broke out around Vladivostok when the Russians tried to shut off gold mining operations and expel Chinese workers there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Central European University Press|editor=Pál Nyíri, Joana Breidenbach|year=2005|isbn=963-7326-14-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=|accessdate=18 March 2012|author=Joana Breidenbach|location=|title=China inside out: contemporary Chinese nationalism and transnationalism|edition=illustrated|quote=Probably the first clash between the Russians and Chinese occurred in 1868.

In 1868, the local Russian government decided to close down goldfields near Vladivostok, in the Gulf of Peter the Great, where 1,000 Chinese were employed. The Chinese decided that they did not want to go back, and resisted. The first clash occurred when the Chinese were removed from Askold Island,|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese resisted a Russian attempt to take Ashold Island and in response, two Russian military stations and three Russian towns were attacked by the Chinese whom the Russians failed to oust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Central European University Press|editor=Pál Nyíri, Joana Breidenbach|year=2005|isbn=963-7326-14-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=khunkhuzy+russians#v=onepage&amp;q=khunkhuzy%20russians&amp;f=false|volume=|accessdate=18 March 2012|author=Joana Breidenbach|location=|title=China inside out: contemporary Chinese nationalism and transnationalism|edition=illustrated|quote=in the Gulf of Peter the Great.

An elaborate system of fortifications was erected between the early 1870s and the late 1890s. A telegraph line from Vladivostok to [[Shanghai]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] was opened in 1871.  That same year a commercial port was relocated to Vladivostok from [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur]]. Town status was granted on 22 April 1880. A coat of arms, representing the [[Siberian tiger]], was adopted in March 1883.

The first [[high school]] was opened in 1899. The city's economy was given a boost in 1916, with the completion of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which connected Vladivostok to [[Moscow]] and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Russian train experience|url=http://www.transsiberianexpress.net/trans-siberian-railway-history.html|accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[October Revolution]], the Bolsheviks took control of Vladivostok and all the Trans-Siberian Railway. During the [[Russian Civil War]], from May 1918,&lt;ref&gt;PRECLÍK, Vratislav.

At the end of the year 1918, after the Russian Revolution, the Chinese merchants in the Russian Far East demanded the Chinese government to send troops for their protection, and Chinese troops were sent to Vladivostok to protect the Chinese community: about 1600 soldiers and 700 support personnel.|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention ended in the wake of the collapse of the White Army and regime in 1919; all Allied forces except the Japanese withdrew by the end of 1920.

In April 1920, the city came under the formal governance of the [[Far Eastern Republic]], a Soviet-backed buffer state between the Soviets and Japan. Vladivostok then became the capital of the Japanese-backed [[Provisional Priamurye Government]], created after a White Army coup in the city in May 1921. The withdrawal of Japanese forces in October 1922 spelt the end of the enclave, with [[Ieronim Uborevich]]'s [[Red Army]] taking the city on 25 October 1922.

As the main naval base of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Soviet Pacific Fleet]], Vladivostok was officially closed to foreigners during the Soviet years. The city hosted [[Vladivostok Summit Meeting on Arms Control|the summit]] at which [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Gerald Ford]] conducted the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] in 1974. At the time, the two countries decided quantitative limits on [[nuclear weapons]] systems and banned the construction of new land-based [[ICBM]] launchers.

[[File:Txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566 f-10d.jpg|left|thumb|Valdivostok and surrounding region ([[Defense Mapping Agency|DMA]], 1988)]]
The city is located in the southern extremity of [[Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula]], which is about {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} long and {{convert|12|km|sp=us}} wide.

The highest point is [[Mount Kholodilnik]], {{convert|257|m|sp=us}}. [[Eagle's Nest Hill]] is often called the highest point of the city; but, with a height of only {{convert|199|m|sp=us}}, or {{convert|214|m|sp=us}} according to other sources, it is the highest point of the downtown area, but not of the whole city.
[[File:VladivostokGoldenHorn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|June 2014 view of Vladivostok and the [[Golden Horn Bay]]]]

Located in the extreme South East of [[Asian Russia]], Vladivostok is geographically closer to [[Anchorage, Alaska]] and even [[Darwin, Australia]] than it is to the nation's capital of [[Moscow]]. In fact, Vladivostok is closer to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] than to the Russian city of [[Sochi]].

===Climate===
Vladivostok has a monsoon-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dwb'') with warm, humid and rainy summers and cold, dry winters. Owing to the influence of the [[Siberian High]], winters are far colder than a latitude of 43 degrees north should warrant given its low elevation and coastal location, with a January average of {{convert|-12.3|C}}. Since the maritime influence is strong in summer, Vladivostok has a relatively cold annual climate for its latitude. Vladivostok's yearly mean of around {{convert|5|C|F}} is some ten degrees lower than in cities on the [[French Riviera]] on a similar coastal latitude in Europe on the other extreme. Winters especially are around {{convert|20|C-change}} colder than on the mildest coastlines this far north.

In winter, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-20|C}} while mild spells of weather can raise daytime temperatures above freezing. The average monthly precipitation, mainly in the form of snow, is around {{convert|18.5|mm|sp=us}} from December to March. Snow is common during winter, but individual snowfalls are light, with a maximum snow depth of only {{convert|5|cm|sp=us}} in January. During winter, clear sunny days are common.

==Economy==
The city's main industries are [[shipping]], commercial [[fishing]], and the [[naval base]]. Fishing accounts for almost four-fifths of Vladivostok's commercial production. Other food production totals 11%.

A very important employer and a major source of revenue for the city's inhabitants is the import of Japanese cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;rad_stats&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/118673/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/56406c10-2faa-4bb1-98dd-189045b0b62b/en/Russian_Analytical_Digest_82.pdf|title=Putin Is Turning Vladivostok into Russia's Pacific Capital|journal=Russia Analytical Digest|issue=82|date=2010-07-12|publisher=Institute of History, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland|pages=9–12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706230818/http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/118673/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/56406c10-2faa-4bb1-98dd-189045b0b62b/en/Russian_Analytical_Digest_82.pdf|archivedate=July 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides salesmen, the industry employs repairmen, fitters, import clerks as well as shipping and railway companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;rp_oliphant&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ruler of the East: The City of Vladivostok Is a Mixture of Promise and Neglect|last1=Oliphant|first1=Roland|journal=[[Russia Profile]]|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vladivostok dealers sell 250,000 cars a year, with 200,000 going to other parts of Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;rp_oliphant&quot;/&gt; Every third worker in the [[Primorsky Krai]] has some relation to the automobile import business. In recent years, the Russian government has made attempts to improve the country's own car industry. This has included raising tariffs for imported cars, which has put the car import business in Vladivostok in difficulties. To compensate, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the car manufacturing company [[Sollers JSC|Sollers]] to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It is planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;rad_stats&quot;/&gt;[[File:Золотой мост, июль 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Zolotoy Bridge]] across bay in the city|left]]

==Transportation==
[[File:Russki Island Bridge, Russia1.jpg|thumb|[[Russky Bridge]]]]

The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was built to connect [[European Russia]] with Vladivostok, Russia's most important [[Pacific Ocean]] port. Finished in 1905, the rail line ran from Moscow to Vladivostok via several of Russia's main cities. Part of the railroad, known as the [[Chinese Eastern Line]], crossed over into [[China]], passing through [[Harbin]], a major city in Manchuria. Today, Vladivostok serves as the main starting point for the Trans-Siberian portion of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge]].[[File:Vladivostok_Railway_station_P8050426_2200.jpg|thumb|[[Vladivostok railway station]]]]Vladivostok is the main air hub in the Russian Far East. [[Vladivostok International Airport]] (VVO) is the home base of Aurora airline - a Russian Far East air carrier, a subsidiary of [[Aeroflot]]. The airline was formed by [[Aeroflot]] in 2013 by amalgamating [[SAT Airlines]] and [[Vladivostok Avia]]. The [[Vladivostok International Airport]] was significantly upgraded in 2013 with a new 3500-metre runway capable of accommodating all aircraft types without any restrictions. The ''Terminal A'' was built in 2012 with a capacity of 3.5 million passengers per year.
International flights connect Vladivostok with
[[Japan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Philippines]] and [[Vietnam]].

It is possible to get to Vladivostok from several of the larger cities in Russia. Regular flights to [[Seattle, Washington]], were available in the 1990s but have been cancelled since. [[Vladivostok Air]] was flying to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from July 2008 to 2013, before its transformation into Aurora airline.[[File:Владивосток, перекрёсток Светланской и Алеутской, 2005-08-15.JPG|thumb|[[Svetlanskaya Street]] in the central part of Vladivostok (August 2005)]]Vladivostok is the starting point of [[M60 highway (Russia)|Ussuri Highway]] (M60) to [[Khabarovsk]], the easternmost part of [[Trans-Siberian Highway]] that goes all the way to [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] via [[Novosibirsk]].  The other main highways go east to [[Nakhodka]] and south to [[Khasan (urban-type settlement)|Khasan]].

===Urban transportation===
On 28 June 1908, Vladivostok's first tram line was started along [[Svetlanskaya Street]], running from the railway station on Lugovaya Street.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  On 9 October 1912, the first wooden cars manufactured in Belgium entered service. Today, Vladivostok's means of public transportation include trolleybus, bus, tram, train, [[funicular]], and ferryboat. The main urban traffic lines are City Centre—Vtoraya Rechka, City Centre—Pervaya Rechka—3ya Rabochaya—Balyayeva, and City Centre—Lugovaya Street.

[[File:Yuri Vladivostok 20030804 118.jpg|thumb|Port of Vladivostok]]In 2012, Vladivostok hosted the [[APEC Russia 2012|24th Summit]] of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum. In preparation for the event, the infrastructure of the city was renovated and improved. Two giant [[cable-stayed bridge]]s were constructed in Vladivostok, namely the [[Zolotoy Rog Bridge]] over the Golden Horn Bay in the centre of the city, and the [[Russky Bridge]] from the mainland to [[Russky Island]], where the summit took place. The latter bridge is the longest [[cable-stayed bridge]] in the world.

===Port===
The port is ice-free all year round (with the help of ice breakers), and in 2002 had a foreign trade turnover worth $275 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vladivostokhotels.ru/info/economy.html Vladivostok Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512144303/http://www.vladivostokhotels.ru/info/economy.html |date=May 12, 2013 }} ('''Russian''') retrieved 18 Sep 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a special economic zone has been settled with the [[free port of Vladivostok]].

===Pokrovskiy Park===
Pokrovskiy Park was once a cemetery. Converted into a park in 1934 but was closed in 1990.  Since 1990 the land the park sits on belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church.  During the rebuilding of the Orthodox Church, graves were found.

===Minny Gorodok===
Minny Gorodok is a {{convert|91|acres|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} public park. Minny Gorodok means &quot;Mine Borough Park&quot; in English. The park is a former military base that was founded in 1880.

==Pollution==
Local ecologists from the ''Ecocenter'' organization have claimed that much of Vladivostok's suburbs are [[pollution|polluted]] and that living in them can be classified as a health hazard.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The pollution has a number of causes, according to ''Ecocenter'' geo-chemical expert Sergey Shlykov. Vladivostok has about eighty industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as shipbuilding and repairing, power stations, printing, fur farming, and mining.

In addition, Vladivostok has a particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecocenter&quot;&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Preobrazhensky, A.&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;Burago, S.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Shlykov.
