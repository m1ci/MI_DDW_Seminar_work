'''Vikingskipet''' (&quot;The Viking Ship&quot;), officially known as '''Hamar Olympic Hall''' ({{lang-no|Hamar olympiahall}}), is an indoor [[Multi-purpose stadium|multi-use]] sport and event venue in [[Hamar]], [[Norway]]. It was built as the [[speed skating rink]] for the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], and has since also hosted events and tournaments in [[ice speedway]], [[rallying|rally]], [[association football]], [[bandy]], [[ice sledge speed racing]], [[flying disc]] and [[track cycling]]. The arena is also used for [[concert]]s, [[trade fair]] and the annual computer party [[The Gathering (computer party)|The Gathering]]. It is the home arena of [[Hamar IL]] bandy team. The venue is owned by [[Hamar Municipality]], and along with [[Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre]] is run by the municipal Hamar Olympiske Anlegg. Vikingskipet has a capacity for 10,600 spectators during sporting events and 20,000 during concerts.

The arena was designed by [[Niels Torp]], and [[Biong &amp; Biong]], and opened on 19 December 1992. The complex cost 230 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). The localization was controversial, as it is located at [[Åkervika]], a [[Ramsar site]]. It is Norway's national venue for speed skating and bandy, and holds annual [[ISU Speed Skating World Cup]] races, as well as regular world championships. It has among other things hosted tournaments of the [[World Allround Speed Skating Championships]], [[European Speed Skating Championships]], [[World Single Distance Championships]], [[World Sprint Speed Skating Championships]], [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships]], [[Speedway Grand Prix]] and [[World Rally Championship]].

==Construction==
During the process of the [[Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] had not specified that it was necessary with an indoor speed skating rink.&lt;ref name=etterbruken&gt;{{cite news |title=Etterbruken – OLs levende spøkelse |last=Anda |first=Torgeir |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |language=Norwegian |date=2 June 1992 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calgary]] had used the indoor [[Olympic Oval]] during the [[1988 Winter Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1988/orw1988pt1.pdf |title=1988 Winter Olympics Official Report |author=[[Canadian Olympic Committee]] |page=144 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114080921/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1988/orw1988pt1.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Albertville]], who were awarded the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], had opted for the outdoor [[L'anneau de vitesse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/orw1992.pdf |title=1992 Olympics Official Report |author=[[French Olympic Committee]] |page=84 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226202512/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/orw1992.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its bid, the speed skating events were planned held at [[Stampesletta]], an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OL-ideens &quot;fedre&quot; angrer |date=15 September 1992 |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |page=18 |last=Anda |first=Torgeir |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games.&lt;ref name=etterbruken /&gt;

Hamar had previously been a venue for international speed skating events at [[Hamar stadion]]. The town was therefore selected to host the two skating venues. In December 1989, it was decided that the new venue would be built at Åkervika, a Ramsar site {{convert|1|km|sp=us|1}} outside downtown Hamar. A compromise was reached whereby the stadium was moved {{convert|50|m|sp=us}} from its original location, two birdwatching towers were built, and a lumber yard was moved.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOOC III: 51&quot;&gt;LOOC (III): 51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nature and Youth]] remained opposed to the plans, stating the location &quot;has destroyed part of one of the world's most important bird reserves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aksjon mot åpningen av Vikingskipet på Hamar |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=29 November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction was passed by the [[Parliament of Norway]] in April 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOOC III: 51&quot;/&gt; Architects were Niels Torp, and Biong and Biong.&lt;ref name=iii54&gt;LOOC (III): 54&lt;/ref&gt; Ole K. Karlsen was selected to build the building, in competition with eleven other contractors.&lt;ref name=gravdal&gt;{{cite news |title=Snart klarsignal for Hamar Olympiahall |last=Gunn |first=Gravdal |date=6 February 1991 |page=52 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ventilation contract worth NOK&amp;nbsp;18 million had originally been awarded to Hagen &amp; Haugan on 29 May 1991. Two days later, the [[Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee]] signed a sponsorship agreement with Norsk Viftefabrikk and [[Elektrisk Bureau]], both part of [[Asea Brown Boveri]], which demanded discounts in their sponsorship payments for not receiving the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nye forhandlinger etter sponsor-bråk |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=16 June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1992, Investa, which owned Ole K. Karlsen, filed for bankruptcy, causing delays in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OL-utbygging stanses av Investa-krisen |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=2 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it opened, Vikingskipet was the largest indoor sports venue in the world, and has twice the spectator capacity of the Olympic Oval.&lt;ref name=gravdal /&gt; The ice rink was first tested on 15 December 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Testet Vikingskipet |last=Kvalheim |first=Svein |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |date=15 December 1992 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially opened on 19 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rekorder på rad og rekke i &quot;Vikingskipet&quot; |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=20 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the venue cost NOK&amp;nbsp;230 million, which was almost entirely financed through state grants. Hamar Municipality contributed by building a co-located fire station for NOK&amp;nbsp;21 million. Local businesses also contributed with NOK&amp;nbsp;8 million. [[Moelven Industrier]] and [[Fireguard (company)|Fireguard]] both contributed in exchange for being able to use the venues for marketing large wooden structures. To finance the operating deficit after the Olympics, Hamar Municipality received a capital grant of NOK&amp;nbsp;30 million, with the interest going to pay for running Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Operating costs were estimated at NOK&amp;nbsp;7 million per year; the venue will receive income of NOK&amp;nbsp;1 million from larger events, NOK&amp;nbsp;1 million will come from free work from the fire department, and NOK&amp;nbsp;1 million from advertisements.&lt;ref name=etterbruken /&gt; Similar to Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Hall and Vikingskipet. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Forvirring om bruk av navn på OL-arenaer |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=2 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:The Gathering 2009 by NRKbeta.jpg|thumb|[[The Gathering (computer party)|The Gathering]] during 2009]]
The venue has a floor area of {{convert|25000|m2|sp=us}} and a volume of {{convert|400000|m3|sp=us}}. The hall has a spectator capacity of 10,600 people, of which 2,000 can be seated. During the Olympics, this included 250 VIP seats, 250 press seats and 100 commentator seats. Access to the inner ring can be provided via an underpass. Lighting is provided at 1,400 [[lux]], while the venue has a ventilation system capable of both heating and cooling, as well as de-moisturizing, and both re-use and circulation of air. The refrigeration unit uses an [[ammonia]] and [[saline water|saline]] solution, which is transported in pipes within the concrete, which allows for an ice temperature of between −5.5&amp;nbsp;and −6.5&amp;nbsp;degrees Celsius (22&amp;nbsp;and 20°F). The heat from the refrigerating unit can be reused.&lt;ref name=youth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idrett.no/nyheter/Documents/YOG2016_Lillehammer_PHOTO.PDF |author=[[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports]] |title=Candidate city for the Winter Youth Olympic Games: Lillehammer 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wIOlQ6Nd?url=http://www.idrett.no/nyheter/Documents/YOG2016_Lillehammer_PHOTO.PDF |archivedate=6 February 2011 |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rink itself is {{convert|400|m|sp=us}} long, with a turning radius of {{convert|25.5|m|sp=us}}. Within the speed skating rink lies a bandy field. The venue was designed to also allow for association football, cycling, [[track and field]], [[curling]], [[motorsports]] and [[cross-country skiing]].&lt;ref name=iii54 /&gt; The inside of the track can also be used for association football, with pitch dimensions up to {{convert|105|by|68|m|sp=us}}. It can also function as an indoor [[driving range]] for [[golf]].&lt;ref name=youth /&gt; The name derives from the roof looking like the [[keel]] of a [[Viking ship]]. The building is visible from the [[European route E6|E6]] motorway and the [[Dovre Line]] passing through Hamar, and was planned to be Hamar's main [[landmark]].&lt;ref name=gravdal /&gt;

==Transport==
During the Olympics, transport was in part provided by [[Vikingskipet Station]] on the [[Røros Line]], which passes right next to the venue. The station is a [[cul-de-sac]] station which is [[railway electrification system|electrified]] and allowed trains during the Olympics and the Track Cycling World Championships to reach the venue within a short walk from the train.&lt;ref name=holdeplass&gt;{{cite news |title=Jernbaneverket vil ha godsterminal i Hamar |work=[[Hamar Dagblad]] |language=Norwegian |date=21 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was officially opened on 16 August 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forsk.njk.no/stdb/index.php?mod=st&amp;aut=&amp;detaljert=1&amp;baneID=102&amp;Stnr=3101,01&amp;sid=1235 |title=Vikingskipet |author=[[Norwegian Railway Club]] |accessdate=4 January 2011 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station has not been used since the Olympics. In 2006, the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] proposed re-opening the station in conjunction with larger events.&lt;ref name=holdeplass /&gt;

==Events==

Prior to the Olympic Games, the venue hosted three [[world championship]]s in 1993. In February, it hosted all but two preliminary matches of the [[1993 Bandy World Championship]]. To make the games more attractive, preliminary round matches were reduced from 90 to 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bandy-VM med nytt opplegg i Hamar og Oslo |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=27 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final was spectated by 5,338 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bandy-VM søndag |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian |date=7 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; For four months, the venue was equipped with a [[velodrome]], which allowed the venue to host the [[1993 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]].&lt;ref name=etterbruken /&gt; The velodrome cost NOK&amp;nbsp;95 million less than building a permanent velodrome in [[Oslo]], which would be hosting the [[1993 UCI Road World Championships]]. The [[Norwegian Cycling Federation]] had originally bid for the championships to get a permanent velodrome built at [[Hasle, Oslo|Hasle]] in Oslo, but declined the offer and instead chose the temporary concept. Because the velodrome only has a circumference of {{convert|250|m|sp=us}}, the venue's spectator capacity was reduced to 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Den billige velodromen |last=Bugge |first=Mette |last2=Hansen |first2=Espen |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 January 1992 |page=15 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamar was the center for skating sports during the 1994 Winter Olympics. The other venue in town was Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, which featured the [[Short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|short track speed skating]] and [[Figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|figure skating]] events.&lt;ref&gt;LOOC (III): 57&lt;/ref&gt; Vikingskipet held ten [[speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|speed skating]] events, five for men and five for women. Norway's [[Johann Olav Koss]] took three golds, in the [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Men's 1500 metres|men's 1,500 meters]], [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Men's 5000 metres|5000 meters]] and [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Men's 10000 metres|10000 meters]]. In the latter two, he finished ahead of fellow countryman [[Kjell Storelid]]. The [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Men's 500 metres|men's 500 meters]] was won by Russia's [[Aleksandr Golubev (speed skater)|Aleksandr Golubev]] ahead of fellow countryman [[Sergey Klevchenya]], while the [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Men's 1000 metres|men's 1000 meters]] was won by American [[Dan Jansen]]. Koss and Jansen won their olympic golds setting new world record time on their distances. For women, American [[Bonnie Blair]] defended her two 1992 golds in [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Women's 500 metres|500 meters]] and [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Women's 1000 metres|1000 meters]]. Austria's [[Emese Hunyady]] won the [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Women's 1500 metres|1500 meters]] ahead of Russia's [[Svetlana Bazhanova]] and Germany's [[Gunda Niemann]]. However, Bazhanova took gold ahead of Nemeth-Hunyady on the [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Women's 3000 metres|3000 meters]], with Germany's [[Claudia Pechstein]] in third. Pechstein would go on to win the [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Women's 5000 metres|5000 meters]] ahead of Niemann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1994/SSK/ |title=Speed Skating at the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games |publisher=Sports Reference |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uvpFOiB0?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1994/SSK/ |archivedate=12 December 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikingskipet was proposed to also host [[curling at the Winter Olympics|curling]], should it be included in the Olympic program. It had been  a [[demonstration sport]] in [[curling at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] and [[curling at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]] Olympics, but was eventually discarded from the Lillehammer program. The event would have used the same production equipment as for speed skating, and would have consisted of a four-team tournament for both men and women, and would have been held during the Games' two last days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Curling med allerede i neste OL? |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=13 October 1992 |page=40 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikingskipet was the venue for [[Ice sledge speed racing at the 1994 Winter Paralympics|ice sledge speed skating]] during the 1994 Winter Paralympics. Eight events were held, four for women and four for men. The event had 22 participants from 7 nations competing for 24 medals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fikset 8 gull |last=Brandås |first=Frank |work=[[Nordlys]] |language=Norwegian |date=15 March 1994 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 23 of 24 medals being awarded to Norwegian athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norsk gulldryss på isen |work=[[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian |date=15 March 1994 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Helnorsk i ispigging igjen  |last=Nygaard |first=Brynjulf |work=[[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian |date=17 March 1994 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atle Haglund]] set two world records.&lt;ref name=verdensrekorder /&gt;

The venue is the national stadium for speed skating in Norway. It hosts annual [[ISU Speed Skating World Cup]],&lt;ref name=youth /&gt; and has in addition hosted many European and world championships.
