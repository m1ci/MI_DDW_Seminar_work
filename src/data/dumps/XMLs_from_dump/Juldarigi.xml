'''''Juldarigi''''' ({{korean|hangul=줄다리기}}, also '''''chuldarigi''''') is a traditional [[Korea]]n sport similar to [[tug of war]]. It has a ritual and divinatory significance to many agricultural communities in the country, and is performed at festivals and community gatherings. The sport uses two huge rice-straw ropes, connected by a central peg, which are pulled by teams representing the East and West sides of the village (the competition is often rigged in favour of the Western team). A number of religious and traditional rituals are performed before and after the actual competition.

Several areas of Korea have their own distinct variations of ''juldarigi'', and similar tug-of-war games with connections to agriculture are found in rural communities across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Cultural significance==
''Juldarigi'' is an important part of several agricultural celebrations, and is a common event at the [[Daeboreum]] lunar festival.&lt;ref name=Folkmuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/subjectindex.jsp?d=seasonal&amp;tit_idx=238&amp;f=F5|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many Korean rural folk traditions, the sport is regarded as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, ''juldarigi'' and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South.&lt;ref name=Folkmuseum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yeongsan juldarigi|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/TVCommon_NoStaff_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0556&amp;MENU_CODE=101233&amp;view_seq=4177&amp;Page=5&amp;sys_lang=Eng|work=100 Icons of Korean Culture|publisher=Arirang TV|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between [[Dragon#East Asia|dragons]] (which the ropes of the ''juldarigi'' are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result ''juldarigi'' or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt; The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.&lt;ref name=Folkmuseum/&gt;

==Equipment==
The straw ropes used in ''juldarigi'' are immense, up to 200m in length and 1m in diameter. They can weigh as much as 40 tons.&lt;ref name=dangjin&gt;{{cite web|title=Gijisi Juldarigi Museum|url=http://www.dangjin.go.kr/html/eng/culture/culture_01_09.html|work=Energetic Dangjin|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are constructed of twisted rice straw; this choice of material is symbolic, since rice is the staple grain in the areas where ''juldarigi'' is practiced. The construction process is a communal event, reflecting the communal nature of rice cultivation.&lt;ref name=arirang/&gt; Two ropes are used, one for each team; they are connected by a wooden beam or stump known as a ''binyeomok'', around three metres long.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The rope held by the Eastern team is termed the ''sutjul'' ({{korean|hangul=숫줄}} &quot;male rope&quot;) and the Western team hold the ''amjul'' ({{korean|hangul=암줄}} &quot;female rope&quot;).&lt;ref name=Folkmuseum/&gt;  Because of the ropes' great size, they cannot be grasped directly; players attached smaller side-ropes to the main rope to act as handles and fray its ends to provide additional hand-holds.&lt;ref name=koreana&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kwang-on|title=Tug-of-War: Pulling the Rope for a Bumper Harvest|journal=Koreana|year=1995|volume=9|issue=4|url=http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=683|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic of Korea: Folk games and rite|url=http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&amp;idx=&amp;listLIDX=36&amp;searchtext=|work=ICH Archives|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140806163906/http://www.ichcap.org:8888/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&amp;idx=&amp;listLIDX=36&amp;searchtext=|archivedate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremony==
The ceremony leading up to the tug of war begins at around midnight on the eve of the festival. Both teams repair to their respective ropes and offer prayers for victory; this rite is known as ''goyu'' ({{korean|hangul=고유|hanja=告由}}). During this time, the teams guard their ropes against tampering, as well as preventing members of the opposing team from stepping over it (it is believed that a woman who steps over the rope at this time will conceive a male heir). Punishments can be severe; there are records of a woman being stoned to death in the early 20th century for such an infraction.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt; The teams then gather at the festival site and perform further prayers, this time for the safety and prosperity of the village; sacrifices are also offered to [[Teojushin]], the earth goddess. These communal rituals are called ''gosa'' ({{korean|hangul=고사|hanja=告祀}}). At dawn, after the completion of these ceremonies, the two teams fetch their ropes to the site; this involves a procession with flags and costumes, accompanied by percussion music. There is then a staged debate over the connection of the two ropes, which has a symbolic sexual aspect; innuendo and bawdy taunts of the other team are common.&lt;ref name=Folkmuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;

Once the two ropes are lashed together around the ''binyeomok'', the contest begins, to the shouts and cheers of the celebrants. The actual competition is short, with victory usually decided after a single pull (although some contests are played to best of three). Because of the association of the Western direction with the concept of fertility and fecundity, the match is often fixed to ensure that the West team win (and thus ensure a bounteous harvest). After celebrating at the house of their team's captain, the winners will then proceed to the house of the losing team's captain to offer their commiserations; this often resembles a funeral procession.&lt;ref name=Folkmuseum/&gt; Both ropes are taken by the winning team, dissected and sold; the straw taken from them is believed to have unusual protective or nourishing properties.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;

A children's version, known as ''gosat juldarigi'' ({{korean|hangul=고삿줄다리기}}, &quot;alley tug-of-war&quot;) is often played in the streets before the main event.&lt;ref name=Folkmuseum/&gt;

==Regional variations==
Two forms of ''juldarigi'', from Gijisi ([[Dangjin]]) and [[South Gyeongsang Province|Yeongsang]], are recognised as [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea]].&lt;ref name=arirang&gt;{{cite web|title=Gijisijuldarigi, A Tug-Of-War Held to Pray for A Bountiful Harvest|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/ALegacy_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=tvcr0301&amp;view_cont_seq=25&amp;code=St1&amp;sys_lang=Eng|work=Ancestral Legacies|publisher=Arirang TV|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;YuLee2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Myǒng-jong Yu|author2=Ji-Hye Lee|author3=Sung-young Jeon|title=One hundred cultural symbols of Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFoqAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 April 2013|year=2008|publisher=Discovery Media|isbn=978-89-956091-6-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwalliguk2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Korea (South).

The centipede-like shape of the rope is said to resemble the way in which the villages of the region are arranged.&lt;ref name=arirang/&gt; Gijisi is also home to a museum devoted to the practice of ''juldarigi''.&lt;ref name=dangjin/&gt;

The [[Miryang Baekjung Festival]] features a unique form of this sport called ''gejuldarigi'' ({{korean|hangul=거미줄다리기}}) or &quot;spider tug-of-war&quot;, which is unique to Miryang. In this version, participants are tied by ropes to a central ring, and pull in all directions.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HarveyKim2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=John H. T. Harvey|author2=Sydney Kim|title=Korean cultural insights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EMxAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=2005|publisher=Korea Tourism Organization|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar communal tug-of-war games take place in [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Myanmar]], in all cases having a connection to fecundity and the prospect of a bountiful harvest. The [[Kansai region]] of [[Japan]] also has a tug-of-war ceremony which is believed to have been introduced by Korean immigrants.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;
