'''Nepalgunj''' ({{IPA-ne|nepaːlɡəndʒ|}}), also spelled '''Nepalganj''', is a [[List of cities in Nepal#Alphabetical list|Sub-Metropolitan City]] in [[Banke district|Banke]] [[districts of Nepal|District]], [[Nepal]]. It lies on the [[Terai]] plains near the southern border with [[Bahraich district]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. Nepalgunj is 153 kilometers south-west of [[Ghorahi]] and 16&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kohalpur]]. Former [[Village development committee (Nepal)|Village Development Committee]]: [[Udayapur, Bheri|Udayapur]], [[Bhawaniyapur]], [[Piparhawa|Piprahawa]], [[Jaispur]], [[Parsapur|Paraspur]], [[Indrapur, Bheri|Indrapur]], [[Khaskarkado]], [[Bashudevpur]], [[Manikapur]] and [[Puraina]] were added to territory in order to make it Sub metropolitan city on 2071 Paush 28 and later [[Puraini]] was also added in list on 2072 Paush 21. Further, while restructuring of local levels nationwide, ward no. 23 (former [[Indrapur, Bheri|Indrapur]] VDC) was taken out to [[Janaki Rural Municipality]] and ward no. 7 of [[Hirminiya]] VDC was added to Nepalgunj.

==Overview==
The Dhamboji neighborhood is the center of the city and main business hub. The 24&amp;nbsp;km long Surkhet Road runs through the middle of the city.

==Demographics==
The 2011 census counted 73,779 inhabitants, with 20% growth since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nepal: Provinces, Zones, Districts, Cities, Urban Municipalities - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Nepal.html |website=www.citypopulation.de |accessdate=27 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepali language|Nepali]] is spoken natively by [[Pahari people|Paharis]] as well as by people of other ethnicities as the national language and [[lingua franca]]. The mother tongue for the native inhabitants is still [[Awadhi]], which is understood and normally spoken by the entire population of the district.

==Culture and religion==
Nepalgunj has a diverse culture with people from different faiths living within mixed communities. [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] are two major religions in the city, with Hindus comprising the larger percentage of the population. The city also has followers of other religions like [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Christianity]]. People of different ethnicity are known to have traditionally lived together, without any significant conflicts. [[Muslim]] have grown in unprecedented numbers in the region.

However, recent conflict occurred in December 2006 between the [[Pahari people]] and the [[Madhesi people]], following immediately after the [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal]]. The conflict resulted in the death of at least one person, while dozens of others were injured.

==Transport==
[[File:Nepalgunj airport.jpg|thumb|Nepalgunj airport]] [[Nepalgunj Airport]] is located 6&amp;nbsp;km north of the city centre. The airport was officially named Mahendra Airport after the late [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra]], but it is commonly referred to as Ranjha Airport. It operated flights to [[Tribhuvan International Airport|Kathmandu]] and to airports in less developed western districts such as [[Dolpa Airport|Dolpa]], [[Jumla Airport|Jumla]], [[Mugu District|Mugu]] and [[Rukumkot Airport|Rukum]].

[[File:Surkhet Road Pipari.jpg|thumb|Section of the newly widened Surkhet road at Pipari]]Nepalgunj has bus and mini-bus services. The country's longest highway, [[Mahendra Highway]], runs through the town of [[Kohalpur]], 10 kilometers from Nepalgunj city center.

An [[Indian Railways]] line reaches [[Rupaidiha]] across the border. It involves train changes at [[Gonda, Uttar Pradesh|Gonda]], [[Bahraich]] and [[Nanpara]]. For travellers coming in from India it is also possible to take an express train to [[Lucknow]] and from there a direct bus to Rupaidiha. Indian and Nepalese nationals may cross the border without restrictions; however, there is a [[Geography of Nepal#Border crossing|customs checkpoint]] for goods and third country nationals.
