'''Tultepec''' is a city and [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] located in [[State of Mexico]], [[Mexico]]. It lies directly north of [[Mexico City]] in the northeastern part of the State of Mexico, making it part of the [[Greater Mexico City]] urban area. The name comes from [[Náhuatl]] meaning 'hill of the '[[tule]]'.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15108a.htm |title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Tultepec |accessdate= 2008-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The census of 2005 reported a population of 57,586 for the city and 110,145 for the municipality as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=Link to tables of population data from Census of 2005] INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática |accessdate=2008-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EjXaEdST?url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archivedate=2013-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The city==
[[File:TortitosTultepec2016 0171.webm|thumb|left|Parade of toritos on the streets of the historic center for the feast of John of God]]
The area was first settled by the [[Chichimeca]]s, followed by the [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s in the seventh century. After the Spanish Conquest, Tultepec was given to the conquistador Alonso Ávila along with the current municipalities of [[Zumpango]], [[Xaltocan, Tlaxcala|Xaltocán]], [[Huehuetoca]], [[Coyotepec]], [[Teoloyucan, Mexico State|Teoloyucan]] and others, as part of the [[Encomienda]] de [[Cuautitlán]]. The modern town of Tultepec began to take shape around 1610 in the valley next to a small elevation called San Martín. [[Franciscan]]s came to evangelize the new community, dedicating it to the Nativity of Holy Mary and constructing a temple in 1618. This temple, later a parish, was renovated between 1948 and 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;/&gt; 

The town and municipality boast of a number of musicians and painters including Hernesto Urbán Rodríguez (1894), Ricardo Vázquez Pineda (1894), Victor Manuel Urbán Silva (1894), Andrés Urbán (1870) and Prudenciano García (1880), as well as modern composers such as Victor Urbán Velasco, Gerardo Urbán Velásco, Francisco Vázquez García, Francisco Romero Linares, and J. Isabel Vázquez Solano.  Better-known painters include Miguel Hernández Urbán, Joaquín González Romero, Margarito González Solano, Gregorio González Solano, and Albino Luna Sánchez.  It is the home of a folk dance group that has toured the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;/&gt;

==Fireworks industry==
[[File:FeriaPirtecniaTultepec43.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Castillos at the National Fireworks Festival]]
In the past, when the town was still rural, the economy was based on products such as [[pulque]], animal feed, salt and [[tequesquite]] as well as domestic fowl and other small animals, mostly to be sold in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;/&gt;

Nowadays, the [[pyrotechnics]] industry is the major industry in Tultepec.  Every year, the town throws a [[National Pyrotechnic Festival|weeklong festival]] with fireworks competitions among various producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alisa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://alisacooper.typepad.com/photos/tultepec_fireworks/index.html |title= Tultepec Pyrotechnics |accessdate=2008-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pioneers in pyrotechnics came from Tultepec, including Agustín, Miguel and Gregorio Fiesco (1880); José Solano Urbán (1900–1920), who revolutionized firework sets and castles; Felipe Reyes, who worked on the colors red and yellow around 1920; Ángel Guadalupe Flores, who around 1920 invented star fireworks and sparklers as well a several types of rockets; Cirilo Sánchez (1920), who worked on aerostatic balloons; as well as Tomás Romero, Ángel Urbán Rivero, Marcos Romero, and Felipe Fiesco, who innovated such items as the electric target, the spider bomb, and two-figure wheels between 1930 and 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;/&gt;

The city and municipality hosts the annual [[National Pyrotechnic Festival]].

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, Tultepec has governing jurisdiction over the following communities: Guadalupe, Rancho el Cuquío, Maite (Granja Maite), San Antonio Xahuento, Rancho San Joaquín, Santiago Teyahualco, Rancho la Virgen, Ejido Tultepec, Rancho Nodín, Paraje Trigo Tenco, Ejido de Teyahualco, Hacienda Real de Tultepec, Unidad CTM San Pablo, Barrio de San Martín, Ejido San Pablito (Paraje San Pablito), Colonia las Brisas, La Rinconada, La Saucera, Cajiga (Ejido de Tultepec), El Progreso, Colonia la Aurora and Fraccionamiento Paseos de Tultepec II.&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI&quot;/&gt;

The municipality is bordered by the municipalities of [[Nextlalpan]], [[Melchor Ocampo]], [[Tultitlán]], [[Coacalco]] and [[Cuautitlán]]. Most of the area is a plain with small hills, the largest of which is called Otzolotepec. Temperatures range between 6 and 28°C, but much of the local ecosystem has been destroyed due to urbanization.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;/&gt;

The territory surrounding the town of Tultepec used to be much larger.  The current municipality took shape at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th when areas were split off to create the current municipality of Melchor Ocampo.  The municipal palace was constructed in 1870. Tultepec municipality currently has an area of 19.02&amp;nbsp;km² (7.344 sq mi).&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;/&gt;  Another major town in the municipality is [[Santiago Teyahualco]]. 

Outside the main town, there is still some agricultural activity including the raising of animal feed, beans, corn, wheat and [[alfalfa]], and the raising of animals such as cattle and pigs, but agricultural land is shrinking.  There are over 79 manufacturing establishments in the municipality including Asfalto Industria and Nacional Constructora. Communities involved in the manufacture of fireworks also serve as tourist attractions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMuc&quot;/&gt;

==Mammoth skeletons were discovered in Tultepec, Mexico.==
Archaeologists have discovered a large trove of mammoth skeletons in Tultepec, north of Mexico City, possibly shedding new light on the hunting habits of prehistoric communities.

Researchers from Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History say they have uncovered what could be the first human-made traps used to capture the Pleistocene animals. 6

The finding represents a significant turning point in researchers’ understanding of the relationship of hunter-gatherer bands with the mammoths, Pedro Francisco Sánchez Nava, the institute’s national coordinator of archaeology, said in a statement on Wednesday. 7
