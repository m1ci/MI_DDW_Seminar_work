'''Ringette''' is a team sport with two variations, an indoor and an outdoor version. The winter sport is played on an [[ice rink]]. One indoor court version is called gym ringette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ontario-ringette.com/gymringette.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221082720/http://www.ontario-ringette.com/gymringette.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game objective is to outscore the opposing team. The sport is played on an [[ice]] surface, and requires the use of ice hockey skates. The sport uses a blue rubber pneumatic ring and all players, with the exception of goaltenders, use a straight stick ending in a ridged plastic tip. One of the sport's most recognizable and defining features is the fact that it does not involve the use of intentional body contact as a strategic component. Despite its primary popularity among female participants, the sport is officially mixed.

In the sport's home nation, Canada, the nations elite ringette players play in the [[National Ringette League]] (NRL). The final competition is held annually at the [[Canadian Ringette Championships]]. The winning team in the NRL division is awarded the [[Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ringette.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CRC-Trophies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; named after the late [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Jeanne Sauvé]]. Initially coined the ''Jeanne Sauvé Cup'' and initiated in December 1984, it was first presented at the 1985 Canadian Ringette Championships in [[Dollard des Ormeaux]], [[Québec]]. It is now entitled the '''''Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup''''', in memory of the late Governor General of Canada and is awarded to the best team in the National Ringette League.

==History==
Ringette is a winter season team sport played on an ice rink using ice skates. From its beginnings on a skating rink in 1963 in Espanola, Ontario, the sport has spread to the United States, Finland, Sweden, and France. In Canada, an annual national level competition is held called the Canadian Ringette Championships. The sport is also included in the [[Canada Winter Games]].

Ringette was invented in 1963 by the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA), led by the two founders of ringette, [[Sam Jacks]], from West Ferris, Ontario, director of Parks and Recreation for the city of [[North Bay, Ontario]] and [[Mirl &quot;Red&quot; McCarthy]], recreation director for the town of [[Espanola, Ontario]]. The title of birthplace of ringette is shared by both North Bay, Ontario, and Espanola, Ontario, where the first game was played in the fall of 1963 under the direction of McCarthy.

NORDA was a regional organization composed of members from a large area that included the [[Ontario]] communities of North Bay, Espanola, [[Deep River, Ontario|Deep River]], [[Elliot Lake, Ontario|Elliot Lake]], [[Huntsville, Ontario|Huntsville]], [[Sturgeon Falls, Ontario|Sturgeon Falls]], [[Timmins, Ontario|Timmins]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]], Onaping and Phelps, as well as [[Témiscaming]], [[Québec]]. This body recognized the problem of limited girls' winter recreational programmes and decided to find a solution.

===Naming the sport===

The first time the name &quot;ringette&quot; is mentioned was at the NORDA meetings held on January 20 and 21, 1963 in Sudbury, Ontario. Sam Jacks advised the group that &quot;he had been working on a new girls' court game&quot;. Jacks had first considered an inside floor game for females, presumably based on his previous success with floor hockey.

At their September 15 and 16, 1963 meeting at North Bay's [[RCAF]] base, Sam Jacks informed the group that he would &quot;like to have NORDA receive credit as a body for the birth of this game.&quot; Each one of the sports directors left this meeting agreeing to develop the game in their own community and report their findings at the next NORDA meeting in early 1964.

===First game===

Under the guidance of Mirl Arthur &quot;Red&quot; McCarthy, the first game of ringette was held between Espanola high school girls at the Espanola Arena in the fall of 1963. He wrote up a set of rules and created a ring for this occasion, still on display inside the Espanola arena.

In 1963-1964, McCarthy's original ringette rules became experimental in the following Northern Ontario and Quebec communities:

* Espanola, Ontario Arena
* Onaping, Ontario Playground
* Sudbury, Ontario Kingsway Playground
* Sudbury Grace Playground
* Sudbury Adamsdale Playground
* Sudbury Barrydowne Playground
* Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario
* Témiscaming, Québec Arena

McCarthy presented a written list of rules which he had developed, combined with comments and observations to NORDA at their meeting at Moose Lake Lodge in Onaping, Ontario (Sudbury), on January 19 and 20, 1964.

===First league===

In 1964-1965, Sudbury, Ontario formed the first ever ringette league, comprising four teams. Diana Heit, assistant program director of Sudbury Parks and Recreation department, helped the teams with schedules, rules, and coaching.

===First invitational tournament===

On March 5, 1966, the first invitational tournament, the Northern Ontario and Quebec championships, was held in Temiscaming, Quebec. The tournament took place with five teams participating: North Bay Police Playground, Sudbury Rose Marie Playground, Sudbury East End Playground, Temiscaming Reds, and Temiscaming Whites. The tournament was won by the Temiscaming Reds team. This historic tournament created many firsts for the game of ringette:

# The first ringette tournament.
# The first interprovincial tournament.
# The first tournament in Quebec.
# The first tournament for the Canadian and World Championship.
# The first indoor tournament.
# The first tournament on artificial ice.
# The first crests ever created and awarded for the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Kenneth|title=The Ring Starts Here: An Illustrated History of Ringette|year=2004|publisher=[[Highway Book Shop]]|location=Cobalt, Ontario|isbn=0-88954-438-7|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction to North Bay===

Ringette was introduced in North Bay on January 21, 1965, at the Kiwanis Playground with teams from Kiwanis and Police zones participating. The game ended in a 5-5 overtime tie. Attempts were being made to form a four-team league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=North Bay Nugget|date=January 23, 1965|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in ringette came slowly to North Bay as ice time was seldom available. It was not until 1971-72 that West Ferris, Ontario, today part of North Bay, had a four-team league operating.

===Introduction to Quebec===

Ringette was introduced to the province of Québec by Bob Reid, director of recreation for Témiscaming, secretary, and chairman of NORDA.

===Further developments===

By 1965-66, NORDA decided that they had carried the game about as far as it could go. The Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario (SDMRO) was chosen to develop and organize it further on a larger scale.

By 1973, an agreement was worked out between SDMRO and the Ontario Ringette Association (ORA) where the copyright to the Official Ringette Rules would be held by the ORA. Finally, in 1983 in agreement with the ORA, these rights were acquired by Ringette Canada.

==The legacy of Samuel and Agnes Jacks==

The West Ferris Arena, today called the '''West Ferris Centennial Community Centre''', was built in 1967, four years after the birth of the sport in 1963 at the Espanola arena. The West Ferris arena, surrounding ball fields, and tennis courts is together called the Sam Jacks Recreational Complex.

After Sam Jacks died in May 1975, his wife Agnes promoted the game and acted as an ambassador for the sport until her own death in April 2005. She was awarded the [[Order of Canada]].

==The legacy of Mirl &quot;Red&quot; McCarthy==

==Basic rules of play==
The format of game is 2 halves with 20 minutes in each period.

However, in the National Ringette League the format of the game is 4 quarters, 13 minutes each with a 10 to 12 minute break between the second and third quarters.

===Players===
Only six players on each team are permitted on the ice at one time, one [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]], two [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]], two [[Defense (sport)|defenders]], and a [[goaltender]].

===Pulling the goalie===

A team may pull the goalie off the ice and one more player may go in the offensive or defensive end. If the goalie is pulled and the play returns to that team's defensive end, one skater may become an acting goaltender. Once they enter the [[Ringette#Crease|crease]], they are bound by the same rules as a regular goaltender.
If a team pulls the goalie without adding an additional player to the ice, the goalie may return to the defensive end.

===Center Ice  Free Pass===
The game begins with the visiting team receiving control of the ring on the defending half of the center circle.  One player from the visiting team must pass the ring to another player within five seconds, without leaving the half circle or crossing the centre line, or else possession is lost and granted to the home team.

===Blue lines===
Players are not permitted to carry the ring over the two blue lines; they must advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The ring must be touched by any other player first, but does not need to be under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces the ring off a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches the ring consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given a free pass. If the ring goes over both blue lines, the team that passed it may not touch it until the opposing team touches the ring.

If a goaltender throws the ring across the blue line, a delayed [[Ringette#Violations|violation]] is signalled. The goaltender may use their stick to pass the ring over the blue line.

===Free Play Line ({{aka}} Ringette Line)===
The red line at the top of the defensive circles is called the Free Play Line.  It marks the restricted area of each team's attacking/defending zones.  Only three players from each team, plus the defending goaltender, are permitted into the restricted areas.

Exceptions include:
* The defending team must have one player out of the free play area.  If a team has two penalized players, only two players in addition to the goaltender may be in the zone.
*  If a team has pulled their goaltender, an additional player is allowed into the attacking or defending zone.  The goaltender must be completely off the ice before the additional player is permitted to enter. Once the goalie is pulled, any of the players from that team may enter the goaltender's crease and play as goalie &amp;ndash; but cannot carry the ring out of the crease.

If the violation is non-intentional, the team in violation will lose possession of the ring and have it granted to the non-offending team.  If the violation is deemed intentional, a delay of game penalty is assessed (rare).  If an intentional violation occurs in the last two minutes of the game, a penalty shot is awarded instead. The Extended Zone Line is also known as the &quot;ringette line&quot;.

===Crease===
The crease is the area in front of the net defined by a red semi circle on the ice. Goaltenders are the only players permitted in the crease. If a member of the team with ring possession violates the crease with a stick, skate, etc., the play is stopped and the goalie receives the ring. If any member of the non-possession team violates the crease, their team cannot touch the ring for five seconds (counted by the referee), or possession of the ring is given to the other team.

When the ring enters the crease, the goaltender then has five seconds to throw, pass with stick, deflect, or push the ring out to another player. If the goalie does not pass it within five seconds, the ring is awarded to the other team for a free pass from one of the defensive free play circles. The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease unless they pull it all the way through and out with one motion. Otherwise, this results in a loss of possession, and a penalty if they have already been given a warning. The goalie may not pick up or cover the ring with their glove outside the crease. The goalie can push the ring with a hand when outside the crease, as can any other player.

The team in possession of the ring has 30 seconds to shoot, though this rule does not apply to the younger teams (Bunny/U8, and Novice/U10). The shot clock is reset when possession of the ring changes teams, when the ring stops in the goaltender's crease, or when the ring bounces off of the goalie or the front of the goal posts. The shot clock is only applied in competitive levels, starting at the petite level (U12).

===Violations===
A violation is a minor penalty called for violations of game play rules, usually due to improper movement or handling of the ring.  Common violations include entering the crease, touching the ring on either side of the blue line, four players in the zone and 2 (blue) line passes.

If a violation is committed by the team in possession of the ring, play is stopped immediately.  The ring is awarded to the opposing team in the zone the violation occurred.  If a violation is committed by the team not in possession of the ring, a 'delayed violation' is signaled by the official (arm raised with a 90 degree bend at the elbow) and a 5-second count begins.  If the team in violation touches the ring within that time period, play is stopped and the violation is assessed.  If the count expires, the violation is dropped and play continues.

If a violation occurs that would award the defending team a free pass in their own zone, the ring is given to the goaltender as a &quot;goalie ring&quot;.  Play resumes immediately when the goaltender receives the ring.  Time is not provided for teams to perform line changes as can be done on a free pass, although on-the-fly changes are permitted as in normal play.

===Penalties===
Penalties in ringette have the same concept as in hockey, with the notable exception that less body contact is allowed, and fighting has a zero-tolerance policy. Penalties are of the following classes:

* Minor penalties, such as boarding, charging, cross checking, elbowing, holding, illegal substitution, hooking, high-sticking, tripping, body contact, slashing, unsportsmanlike conduct and interference. The offending player must sit in the [[penalty box]] for two or four minutes depending on the severity of the penalty (other exceptions apply) and her team plays short-handed.  The penalty ends when the team with the penalty is scored on, or the penalty time runs out.  (If the defense is serving two penalties, the oldest penalty ends.)
* A major penalty is assessed for serious offenses, generally involving intent to injure or an intentional penalty action to prevent a shot during the attacking team's breakaway. Major penalties are four minutes in length and do not end upon the scoring of a goal. Interruption of a breakaway by a penalty action can result in a penalty shot.

-- body contact, slashing, tripping, boarding, charging and any other physical contact penalty, and unsportsmanlike can become a four-minute major penalty depending on the severity and roughness. Players may also receive multiple penalties at the same time for a combination of four or more minutes.

* Misconduct and Match penalties may also be called.  They result in a player's ejection from the game. Misconduct and Major penalties also incur a two- or four-minute fully served penalty to be served by a teammate, unless the penalty is assessed to a non-playing bench member.

When a penalty is assessed against the goalie, a teammate on the ice at the time of the offence must serve it.

If the team not in control of the ring commits a penalty, play is not stopped until the penalized team gains control. This is called a delayed penalty. A minor penalty is nullified if a goal is scored during the delay, unless penalties of equal class were called on both teams. While the penalty is delayed, the attacking team can add a sixth skater to the ice by pulling their goalie. This player can enter the play zone as the fourth attacker.

A team can work off at most two penalties at a time. If a team commits a third penalty, the penalized player sits in the penalty box, but her interval does not start until the first of the other penalties expires (and so forth if there are more penalties).  A team plays with a minimum of three skaters on the ice, regardless of the number of penalties. If freeing a player from the penalty box would give the team more players on the ice than it is entitled to (such as when the team is down to three attackers, but there are two other players in the penalty box), she will not be freed until a whistle stops play.  During the stoppage, the team must remove one player from the ice to return to its proper strength.

A team with two penalties can have only two players (instead of the usual three) in its defensive zone. But if a third person is active in the defensive zone while two man down a third penalty will be called. If there is a third penalty that penalty time does not start till the first penalty is over. All three players may enter the offensive zone.

==Equipment==
Required equipment for ringette is similar to ice hockey:
* ringette stick &amp;ndash; are generally lightweight composite or hollow wood, with ridged plastic tips. Heavily splintered sticks and modified hockey sticks are not permitted.
* ringette ring
* ice skates &amp;ndash; goalies may choose to use goalie skates
* shin pads, worn under the pants (or goalie pads)
* protective girdle (standard hockey pants are also permitted so long as the player wears a &quot;cup&quot; or a &quot;jill&quot; to protect genitals)
* ringette pants &amp;ndash; covering pants.
* ringette or hockey gloves 
* elbow pads
* jersey
* helmet with ringette facemask (must have a triangle bar pattern&amp;ndash;either full or half with a plexiglass shield for the eyes; square bars are disallowed because the stick tip can fit through the spaces)
* neck guard
* shoulder pads &amp;ndash; in some associations/provinces, shoulder pads are optional after U12. In Ontario, shoulder pads are necessary until 18+, other provinces may vary.
* mouthguard- in some leagues/provinces.
The ringette facemask is much like a hockey one except the bars are spaced so that the end of a ringette stick cannot enter the mask.  (bars are shaped as triangles, not squares)

Ringette sticks have tapered ends, with plastic tips specially designed with grooves to increase the lift and velocity of the wrist shot. A ringette stick is also reinforced to withstand the body weight of a player &amp;ndash; a ring carrier leans heavily on his/her stick to prevent opposing players from removing the ring. Sticks are flexible and lightweight to bend without breaking.

==Olympic status==
Ringette is currently not in the Olympics. Outreach efforts by officials in both Canada and Finland to have the sport recognized by the International Olympic Committee for inclusion have not been successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Post&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barnes |first1=Dan |title=Canadian ringette is back on the path to prosperity - and just maybe, to beating Finland for once |url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/olympics/canadian-ringette-is-back-on-the-path-to-prosperity-and-just-maybe-to-beating-finland-for-once |website=National Post |accessdate=16 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing methods have included using [[social media]] as well as word of mouth.

Ringette has thus far been excluded from the Olympics partly due to the fact that since the sport is co-ed, it must have 25% of each gender to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Ringette |url=http://stingersports.ca/about-ringette/ |website=Stinger Sports |accessdate=16 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport is typically overlooked by male participants due to its lack of widespread recognition and the more widespread availability of other organized winter sports like ice hockey. Currently, there are not enough males with the skill to qualify for an Olympic team.

In the 2017-2018 ringette season, more than 30,000 players were registered; which is the highest known participation for a season.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Post&quot; /&gt; Decreases in the number of ringette athletes have been attributed to women's hockey being recognized officially as an Olympic sport in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Post&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Jill |title=Fitness: Do the Olympics turn host cities into active cities? |url=https://montrealgazette.com/health/diet-fitness/fitness-do-the-olympics-turn-host-cities-into-active-cities |website=Montreal Gazette |accessdate=16 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robyn Nimegeers, a former ringette athlete that had switched to hockey, said that &quot;When I was younger I wanted to play in the Olympics and stuff like that and ringette wasn't in the Olympics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Devoted ringette players say they prefer it to hockey |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/devoted-ringette-players-say-they-prefer-it-to-hockey-1.2605407 |website=CBC News |accessdate=16 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shelley Coolidge, who is the manager of female hockey development for the Canadian Hockey Association, most women who join hockey appear to participating in sports for the first time and that there is no way to distinguish whether or not participation in women's hockey limits participation in ringette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Beverely |title=Canada out to ring up gold metal |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/canada-out-to-ring-up-gold-medal/article25427111/ |website=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=16 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian status==

===Levels of play in Canada===

There are several levels of play in Ringette, categorized by age. Divisions were recently renamed as U* divisions under the new Long Term Development Plan (LTDP) rolled out nationally by [[Ringette Canada]] for the 2009-10 ringette season:
:'''U6-8''' under 6 or 8 years- this age division has been recently created by only a few associations. It is designed to introduce younger children to the sport and begin to develop skills at an early age. Typically, these young players play modified games (shorter time, no penalties, on half of the ice etc.)
:'''U8''' under 8 (previously called 'Bunny' division)
:'''U9 '''' Under 9 (this is a minor Novice Division)
:'''U10''' primarily 8 &amp; 9 years (previously called the 'Novice' division)
:'''U12''' 10- &amp; 11-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Petite' division)
:'''U14''' 12- &amp; 13-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Tween' division)
:'''U16''' 14- &amp; 15-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Junior' division)
:'''U19''' 16- to 18-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Jr Belle' or 'Belle' division)
:'''18+''' 18 years and older players (previously referred to as 'Open' or adult division, usually included lifelong players under 30)
:'''Masters''' 18 years and older, either lifelong players desiring a slower pace, or new players who begin as adults (this division is part of the league associations but excluded from Provincial tournaments)
'''NRL''' Known as the National Ringette league, for elite players aged 18+

In 2010 the league put back in place previous age groups.

Boys are permitted to play at any age level but are restricted to competing at the &quot;B&quot; level or lower in many places, however efforts to include male players at the AA level is increasing. It isn't uncommon to see boys participating above U9 or U6 divisions in some provinces. Due to the pure speed of the sport, skating is emphasized at these levels. Levels of competition, based on skill, range from recreational to competitive, and include: Rec, C, B, BB, A, and AA and AAA, with AA being the highest level at which league competition occurs.  AAA ringette is typically specific to particular regions who feel another category is necessary to clarify their league or tournament play. For example: AAA teams out of Quebec have played AA teams out of Alberta at various tournaments, including the National Championships. In Alberta, the highest level considered is AA, although they are deemed equal to the AAA teams from areas such as Quebec. For those who like the hockey parallel, playing AA ringette is the same as playing AAA hockey. The [[National Ringette League]] was introduced in 2004-2005 season and includes open-aged players at AA/AAA level.

=== National Ringette League ===
{{Main|National Ringette League}}
[[File:National Ringette League 03.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Bourassa Royal]] against [[Montréal Mission]] in NRL ]]

The National Ringette League (also indicated by the initials NRL) is an elite league of ringette in Canada. The NRL groups together the very best players over the age of 19 in Canada. The NRL consists of fifteen teams separated into two conferences. The Western Conference has 5 teams and the Eastern Conference has 10 teams. The NRL recovers directly from Ringette Canada, the guiding organisation for Ringette in Canada.

=== Canadian Championships ===
{{main|Canadian Ringette Championships}}
The Championnats Canadien d'Ringuette/Canadian Ringette Championships took place for the first time in 1979 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ringette.ca/events/canadian-ringette-championships/|title=Canadian Ringette Championships - Ringette Canada|newspaper=Ringette Canada|access-date=2017-02-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tournament was conceived so as to be able to determine who are the Canadian champions in the categories Under-16 years, Under-19 years and Open (replaced by the National Ringette League since 2008). The Canadian Championships of ringette usually take place in April of every year.
