'''Porvoo''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈporʋoː}}; {{lang-sv|Borgå}} {{IPA-sv|ˈborːɡo||Borgå.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Finland|city]] and a [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]] situated on the southern coast of [[Finland]] approximately {{convert|50|km|-1}} east of [[Helsinki]]. It is one of the six [[Middle Ages|medieval]] towns in Finland, first mentioned as a city in texts from the 14th century. Porvoo is the seat of the Swedish-speaking [[Diocese of Borgå]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]].

The Porvoo Old Town is a popular tourist destination, known for its well-preserved 18th and 19th century buildings and 15th century cathedral, the [[Porvoo Cathedral]]. The Old Town together with [[Porvoonjoki]] River Valley is recognized as historically and culturally significant as one of the [[National landscapes of Finland]].

The municipality's official languages are Finnish and Swedish. In 2014, 64.6% of the population spoke Finnish as their native language, while 30.1% were Swedish speakers. 5.4% had a different native language.

Porvoo's neighbouring municipalities are [[Askola]], [[Loviisa]], [[Myrskylä]], [[Pornainen]], and [[Sipoo]].

==Etymology==
The [[List of towns in Finland|town]] received its name from a Swedish [[Medieval fortification|medieval fortress]] near the river [[Porvoonjoki]], which flows through the town. The name ''Porvoo'' is the Fennicised version of the Swedish name (''{{lang|sv|Borgå}}'') and its parts of ''borg'', meaning &quot;[[castle]]&quot;, and ''å'', &quot;[[river]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katajala.net/keskiaika/suomi/kaupungit.html|title=Keskiaika - Suomen kaupungit keskiajalla|website=Katajala.net|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Porvoo Old Town Hall.jpg|thumb|left|The old Porvoo Town Hall, which is now a museum]]
The area of Porvoo has been inhabited since the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suomalainen tietosanakirja, osa 6|last=Pertti Vihtaranta|display-authors=etal|publisher=Weilin+Göös ja Almagest Oy|year=1992|isbn=951-35-4644-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-historic times, the river [[Porvoonjoki]] was a route of commerce for Finnish tribal [[Tavastians]] who primarily inhabited the inland regions. The Tavastians also had some permanent settlements in the area, such as the village of Hattula (later Strömsberg), which was named after an inland Tavastian village. The original name of the river Porvoonjoki was possibly ''Kukinjoki.'' The name derives from the name of the trade vessel [[Cog (ship)|cog]] which was a common merchant ship in the Baltic Sea in medieval times. The early center of the area was ''Saksala'', meaning &quot;the place of the [[Germans]]&quot;, and deriving from the merchants who were trading in Saksala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hämeen Härkätie|last=Masonen|first=Jaakko|publisher=Tiemuseon julkaisuja 4. Valtion painatuskeskus. Helsinki|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin itämaa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland|year=2010|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=132–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porvoo was colonised by [[Swedes]] in the 13th and 14th centuries after the so-called [[Second Swedish Crusade|Second Crusade]] against Tavastians in 1249-1250. The colonisation was led by the Catholic Church and the kingdom of Sweden. The colonists originated from [[Svealand]], and were provided with seeds, cattle and, tax exemption for four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Porvoo was first mentioned in documents in the early 14th century, and it was given [[city rights]] around 1380, although according to some sources the city was founded in 1346. The old city of Porvoo was formally disestablished and the new city of Porvoo founded in 1997, when the city of Porvoo and the [[Porvoon maalaiskunta|rural municipality of Porvoo]] were consolidated.&lt;ref name=&quot;porvoo20071119&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://matkailu.porvoo.fi/fi/yleista_porvoosta |title= Yleistä Porvoosta |accessdate= 7 January 2009 |last= Jaakkola |first= Marianne |date= 2007-11-19 |publisher= City of Porvoo |location= Porvoo |language= Finnish |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201151343/http://matkailu.porvoo.fi/fi/yleista_porvoosta |archivedate= 1 February 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Sweden]] lost the city of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] to Russia in 1721, the [[episcopal see]] was moved to Porvoo. At this time, Porvoo was the second largest city in Finland.

In 1760, roughly two thirds of all buildings in Porvoo burned to the ground in a [[conflagration]]. During rebuilding, the city planning wasn't altered, instead new buildings were built upon the existing medieval foundations.

After the conquest of Finland by Russian armies in 1808, Sweden had to cede Finland to Russia in 1809 (the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]]). The [[Diet of Porvoo]] in 1809 was a landmark in the [[History of Finland]]. The Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] confirmed the new [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]] (which was essentially the [[Instrument of Government (1772)|Swedish constitution]] from 1772), and made Finland an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] [[Grand Duchy]].

The ''Porvoo Common Statement'' is a report issued at the conclusion of theological conversations by official representatives of four Anglican churches and eight Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches in 1989–1992. It established the [[Porvoo Communion]], so named after the [[Porvoo Cathedral]] where the [[Eucharist]] was celebrated on the final Sunday of the conversations leading to the Statement.

==Urban development==
===Old Town===
[[File:Porvoon Tuomiokirkko.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Porvoo Cathedral]] prior to the fire in May 2006]]
[[File:Barns_on_the_shore_of_the_river.jpg|thumb|Old wooden barns alongside the river]]
The town is famed for its &quot;Old Town&quot; (''{{lang|sv|Gamla Stan}}'' in [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]]), a dense medieval street pattern with predominantly wooden houses from the 17th and 18th centuries. The Old Town came close to being demolished in the 19th century by a new urban plan for the city, but the plan was cancelled due to a popular resistance headed by Count [[Louis Sparre]]. With the need for growth, a plan was envisioned for a new town built adjacent to the Old Town, following a grid plan, but with houses also built of wood.

The central point of the old town is the medieval, stone and brick [[Porvoo Cathedral]]. The cathedral gave its name to the [[Porvoo Communion]], an inter-church agreement between a number of [[Anglican]] and [[Lutheran]] [[religious denomination|denomination]]s. The cathedral is reminiscent of similarly aged churches across Finland, such as the [[Church of St. Lawrence, Vantaa]], as they were designed by the same person, the anonymous German architect ''Pernajan mestari''. The cathedral was damaged by fire on 29 May 2006; the roof was totally destroyed but the interior is largely intact. A drunken youth had started a fire at the church, unaware of recent tarwork and nearby tar containers, accidentally causing a large [[conflagration]]. He was later sentenced to a short prison term and restitutions of 4.3 million euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirkkojakaupunki.fi/uutiset/rikos-ja-rangaistus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315113713/http://www.kirkkojakaupunki.fi/uutiset/rikos-ja-rangaistus |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red-coloured wooden storage buildings on the riverside are a proposed [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The Old Town is a significant source of tourism in the area. Visitors to the capital [[Helsinki]] can embark on day trips to visit the older city. The Old Town also hosts various events, such as an annual Christmas market.

===Later developments===
[[File:Porvoo new housing.jpg|thumb|New housing designed to match older storage buildings across the river]]
By the end of the 20th century, there was pressure to develop the essentially untouched western side of the river. There was concern that growth would necessitate the construction of a second bridge across the river into the town, thus putting further strain on the aging wooden town. An architectural competition was held in 1990, the winning entry of which proposed building the second bridge. Plans for the western side of the river have progressed under the direction of architect [[Tuomas Siitonen]], and both a vehicle bridge and a pedestrian bridge have been built. The design for new housing is based on a typology derived from the old storehouses on the opposite side of the river. Yet another new development entails the construction of a large business park called King's Gate ({{lang-fi|Kuninkaanportti}}, {{lang-sv|Kungsporten}}), which is under construction.

The Porvoo railway station does not have a regular train service, but special museum trains from [[Kerava]] (either with steam locomotives or former [[VR Group|VR]] diesel railcars from the 1950s) operate on summer weekends.&lt;ref name=&quot;porvoo20091014&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.helsinkiww.net/pmr/eng/time2009.html |title= Kerava-Porvoo Museum Train Timetable Summer 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2009|publisher= Porvoo Museum Railway Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suomenkylä===
Suomenkylä ({{lang-sv|Finnby}}) is a village north of the centre of Porvoo and beside the Porvoo river. Suomenkylä has an old school founded by [[Johannes Linnankoski]] in 1898. The village of Suomenkylä also has two burial places from the [[Bronze Age]].

===Kerkkoo===
Kerkkoo ({{lang-sv|Kerko}}) is a village north of the centre of Porvoo and beside the Porvoo river. It has an active school that is over 100 years old. In the village of Kerkkoo, archeologists and townspeople found a stone axe from the [[Bronze Age]].

==Sports==
[[File:Laakkonen sami.jpeg|thumb|[[Bandy]] player [[Sami Laakkonen]], here in the dress of [[Dynamo Kazan Bandy Club|Dynamo Kazan]], now plays for [[Borgå Akilles|Akilles]].]]
The local team [[Borgå Akilles]] plays the sport of [[bandy]], in the highest division, [[Bandyliiga]], and has become Finnish champions twice.

[[Sami Hyypiä]], a former football player for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the Finnish national team, originated from Porvoo.

Lauri Happonen, better known as [[Cyanide_(video_game_player)|Cyanide]], a retired [[League of Legends]] professional player, is from Porvoo.

==Transport==
Porvoo is on the route of the [[European route E18|E18 road]] from [[Helsinki]] to [[St Petersburg]]. It is currently the [[List of Finnish municipalities without scheduled railway services|largest Finnish municipality]] without scheduled railway services, however proposals exist to link Porvoo to the rail network as part of a new rail line from [[Helsinki Central railway station|Helsinki]] to [[Kouvola]] via a [[Lentorata|tunnel]] between [[Pasila railway station|Pasila]] and [[Helsinki Airport station|Helsinki Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.railjournal.com/regions/europe/helsinki-kouvola-direct-link-not-economically-viable/|title=Helsinki – Kouvola direct link &quot;not economically viable&quot;|website=International Rail Journal|date=5 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
