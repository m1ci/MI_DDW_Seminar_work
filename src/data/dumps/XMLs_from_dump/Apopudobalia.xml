      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Apopudobalia''' ({{lang-grc|ἀποπουδοβαλία}}; [[wikt:ἀπο-#Ancient_Greek|ἀπο-]] + [[wikt:πούς#Ancient_Greek|ποδός]] + [[wikt:ball#English|ball]] + [[wikt:-ία#Ancient_Greek|-ία]]) is a fictional sport, which was the subject of a famous [[fictitious entry]] (humorous [[hoax]] or copyright trap in a reference work). Although no such [[sport]] actually existed, the [[German language|German-language]]'' [[Der neue Pauly]] Enzyklopaedie der Antike'', edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, {{ISBN|3-476-01470-3}}) gives a &lt;!--deadpan--&gt; description of it as an ancient [[Greco-Roman]] sport that anticipates modern [[soccer]]. The article goes on to cite suitably sparse documentation for the non-existent sport (this includes a ''[[Festschrift]]'' to one [[Matthias Sammer|M. Sammer]]), and to assert that a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] form of the game enjoyed a certain popularity amongst the [[Roman legion]]s, and consequently spread throughout the Empire as far afield as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], &quot;where the game enjoyed a revival in the 19th century.&quot; (It also notes that the game was frowned upon by some [[early Christian]] writers, such as [[Tertullian]].)

In reality, the ancient Romans did play a game resembling [[Rugby football|rugby]] called ''[[harpastum]]''.
