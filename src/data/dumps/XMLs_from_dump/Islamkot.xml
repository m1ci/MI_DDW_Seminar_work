'''Islamkot''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|اِسلام كوٹ}}}}), ({{lang|sd-arab|Sindhi: اسلام ڪوٽ}}) is a [[taluka]] in the [[Tharparkar District]] in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. Hundreds of [[Azadirachta indica|neem]] trees seen on Islamkot-[[Mithi]], Islamkot-[[Chachro]] and Islamkot-[[Nagarparkar]] roads were planted during chairmanship of Nihalchand Pabani and under his care.
