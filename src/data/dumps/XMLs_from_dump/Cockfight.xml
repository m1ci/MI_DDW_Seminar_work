A '''cockfight''' is a [[blood sport]] between two [[cock (bird)|cock]]s, or '''gamecocks''', held in a ring called a cockpit. The history of raising fowl for fighting goes back 6,000 years. The first documented use of the ''word'' gamecock, denoting use of the [[cock (bird)|cock]] as to a &quot;[[game]]&quot;, a [[sport]], [[pastime]] or [[entertainment]], was recorded in 1634,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamecock |title=gamecock |quote=First Known Use: 1634|dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the term &quot;cock of the game&quot; used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the sport of cockfighting in ''The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting'' in 1607. But it was during [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s [[Magellan's circumnavigation|voyage of discovery]] of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented by [[Antonio Pigafetta]], Magellan's chronicler, in the kingdom of [[Taytay, Palawan|Taytay]].

The combatants, referred to as gamecocks (not to be confused with [[game bird]]s), are specially [[Breed|bred]] and conditioned for increased stamina and strength. Male and female [[chicken]]s of such a [[breed]] are referred to as '''game fowl'''.

Cocks possess congenital [[aggression]] toward all males of the same [[species]]. Wagers are often made on the outcome of the match.

Cockfighting is a [[blood sport]] due in some part to the [[Injury|physical trauma]] the cocks inflict on each other, which is sometimes increased by attaching metal spurs to the cocks' natural spurs. While not all fights are to the death, the cocks may endure significant physical trauma. In some areas around the world, cockfighting is still practiced as a mainstream event; in some countries it is regulated by law, or forbidden outright.

== Process ==
Two owners place their gamecock in the cockpit. The cocks fight until ultimately one of them dies or is critically injured. Historically, this was in a ''cockpit'', a term which was also used in the 16th century to mean a place of [[entertainment]] or frenzied activity. [[William Shakespeare]] used the term in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' to specifically mean the area around the stage of a [[theatre]]. In Tudor times, the [[Palace of Westminster]] had a permanent cockpit, called the [[Cockpit-in-Court]].

Cockfighting is an ancient spectator sport. There is evidence that cockfighting was a pastime in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;Sherman, David M. (2002).

Encyclopædia Britannica 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The sport was popular in ancient times in India, China, Persia, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Ancient Greece in the time of Themistocles (c. 524–460&amp;nbsp;BC). For a long time the Romans affected to despise this &quot;Greek diversion&quot;, but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century AD) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting at the side of the pit.}}

Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma (&quot;the city [-rma] of the cockerel [kukkuta]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Iravatham Mahadevan]].

Some additional insight into the pre-history of European and American secular cockfighting may be taken from ''The London Encyclopaedia'':

{{Quote|At first cockfighting was partly a religious and partly a political institution at Athens; and was continued for improving the seeds of valor in the minds of their youth, but was afterwards perverted both there and in the other parts of Greece to a common pastime, without any political or religious intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54BMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA113|title=The London Encyclopaedia: Or, Universal Dictionary of Science, Art, Literature, and Practical Mechanics, Comprising a Popular View of the Present State of Knowledge.

In some regional variations, the birds are equipped with either metal spurs (called ''gaffs'') or knives, tied to the leg in the area where the bird's natural spur has been partially removed. A ''cockspur'' is a bracelet (often made of leather) with a curved, sharp spike which is attached to the leg of the bird. The spikes typically range in length from &quot;short spurs&quot; of just over an inch to &quot;long spurs&quot; almost two and a half inches long. In the highest levels of 17th century English cockfighting, the spikes were made of silver. The sharp spurs have been known to injure or even kill the bird handlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/rooster_revenge_cockfighting_bird_vdWgYmiTQbLmMBltVoPmxK |title=Cockfighting bird stabs, kills man |work=The New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''naked heel'' variation, the bird's natural spurs are left intact and sharpened: fighting is done without gaffs or taping, particularly in India (especially in [[Tamil Nadu]]). There it is mostly fought naked heel and either three rounds of twenty minutes with a gap of again twenty minutes or four rounds of fifteen minutes each and a gap of fifteen minutes between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banbloodsports.com/camp-cf.htm|publisher=Irish Council Against Bloodsports|accessdate=February 22, 2008|title=Help expose illegal cockfighters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Americas ===

==== Brazil ====

Cockfighting (''rinha de galos'') was banned in 1934 with the help of President [[Getúlio Vargas]] through Brazil's 1934 constitution, passed on 16 July. Based on the recognition of animals in the Constitution, a Brazilian Supreme Court ruling resulted in the ban of animal related activities that involve claimed &quot;animal suffering such as cockfighting, and a tradition practiced in southern Brazil, known as 'Farra do Boi' (the Oxen Festival)&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/articles/ovbrazil.htm |title=Overview of Brazil's Legal Structure for Animal Issues – Lane Azevedo Clayton – Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center = Publish Date: 2011 |publisher=Animallaw.info |accessdate=2014-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731075539/http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/articles/ovbrazil.htm |archivedate=2013-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that &quot;animals also have the right to legal protection against mistreatment and suffering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joinuniverse.com/brazilian-animal-law/ |title=Brazilian animal law – Alex P |publisher=JoinUniverse |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2014-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313203444/http://www.joinuniverse.com/brazilian-animal-law/ |archive-date=2013-03-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Colombia ====

In Colombia, cockfighting is a tradition, especially in the Caribbean region and in some areas of the Andean interior. Cockfights are held during the [[Vallenato Legend Festival|Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata]] in [[Valledupar]]. In August 2010, the Constitutional Court of Colombia rejected a lawsuit that sought to prohibit [[bullfighting]], ''corralejas'' and cockfighting with the argument that they constitute [[animal abuse]]. In March 2019, the same court confirmed such rule, under the argument that cockfighing and bullfighting are traditions with cultural roots in some municipalities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lafm.com.co/colombia/corte-dice-que-corridas-de-toros-y-peleas-de-gallos-son-de-arraigo-cultural|title=Corte dice que corridas de toros y peleas de gallos son de arraigo cultural|last=FM|first=La|date=2019-03-27|website=www.lafm.com.co|language=spanish|access-date=2019-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Asociación Nacional de Criadores de Gallos de Pelea'' organizes an international cockfighting championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/colombia-acoge-campeonato-peleas-gallos/238590-3|title=Colombia acoge campeonato de peleas de gallos|last=Semana|website=Colombia acoge campeonato de peleas de gallos|language=spanish|access-date=2019-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cockfighting was immortalized in the novel [[One Hundred Years of Solitude]] by Gabriel García Márquez, in episodes such as the events that led to the death of Prudencio Aguilar,  or the fondness for it by José Arcadio Segundo. Cockfighting was one of the main subjects of ''La Caponera'', a TV adaptation of [[Juan Rulfo]]'s novel, ''El gallo de oro'', aired in Colombia and other countries in the region during the late 90s.

==== Cuba ====
In Cuba, cockfighting is legal and popular, although gambling on matches has been banned since the [[Cuban Revolution|1959 Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Kirkpatrick, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2015/12/31/cockfighting-has-deep-roots-in-cuba/ Cockfighting has deep roots in Cuba], ''Washington Post'' (December 31, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshMeneghini&quot;&gt;Sarah Marsh &amp; Alexandre Meneghini, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-cockfighting/cockfighting-in-cuba-clandestine-venues-state-arenas-idUSKBN17M1VF Cockfighting in Cuba: clandestine venues, state arenas], Reuters (April 20, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The state has opened official arenas, including a 1,000-seat venue in [[Ciego de Ávila]], but there are also banned underground cockfighting pits.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshMeneghini&quot;/&gt;

==== Mexico ====
[[File:Mexico cockfight (cropped).jpg|thumb|A cockfight in Mexico, ca. 1913]]
Cockfighting is not banned in [[Mexico]], and practiced in the [[Mexican states]] of [[Michoacán]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[Jalisco]], [[Sinaloa]], and [[Veracruz]], mostly during regional fairs and other celebrations. Cockfights are performed in ''palenques'' (pits).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ortega&quot;/&gt; Cockfighting remains legal in the municipality of [[Ixmiquilpan]] and throughout Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digg.com/video/tradition-cockfighting-mexico The Tradition of Cockfighting in Mexico], ''Digg''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peru ====
[[File:Gallonavajeroperuano.jpg|thumb|Cockfight in [[Lima]], Peru]]
According to the ''Encyclopedia of Latino Culture'', Peru &quot;has probably the longest historical tradition&quot; with cockfighting, with the practice possibly dating back to the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ortega&quot;/&gt; Cockfighting is legal and regulated by the government in Peru.

==== India ====
[[File:COCK FIGHT.JPG|thumb|Cockfight in Tamil Nadu, India]]
Cockfighting (''Kodi Pandem'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]])   (''Kori katta'' in [[Tulu language|Tulu]]) (''Vetrukkaal seval porr'' in [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] which means &quot;naked heel cockfight&quot;) is a favourite sport of people living in the coastal region of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi district|Udupi]] districts of [[Tulu Nadu]] region of [[Karnataka]], and the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. Three- or four-inch blades (''Bal'' in [[Tulu language|Tulu]]) are attached to the cocks' legs. Knockout fights to the death are widely practised in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. In [[Tamil Nadu]], the winner is decided after three or four rounds. People watch with intense interest surrounding the cocks. The sport has gradually become a gambling [[sport]].

In [[Jharkhand]] the cockfighting game is known as &quot;pada&quot;, the spurs are called &quot;kant&quot;, the cockpit is called &quot;chhad&quot;, and the person in the cockpit or who ties the spurs is called &quot;kantkar&quot;.

In the Tamil Nadu districts of [[Chennai district|Chennai]], [[Thanjavur district|Tanjore]], [[Tiruchirappalli district|Trichy]] and [[Salem district|Salem]], only the 'naked heel' variation is permitted. In [[Erode district|Erode]], [[Thiruppur district|Thiruppur]], [[Karur district|Karur]] and [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore]] districts, only bloody blade fights are conducted. During festival seasons, this is the major game for men. Women normally don't participate. Only the Pure breeds are chosen to the fight. Naked heel cocks Fight for long duration compared with Blade fight cocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tamil-desiyam.com/seval-sandai-in-tamil/|title=Seval Sandai in Tamil - Tamil Desiyam|date=2018-08-14|work=Tamil Desiyam|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cockfight, or more accurately expressed the [[secular]] cockfight, is an intense [[sport]], [[recreation]], or [[pastime]] to some, while to others, the cockfight remains an ancient [[religious]] [[ritual]], a [[sacred]] [[ceremony]] (i.e. a [[religious]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] cockfight) associated with the ‘daivasthanams’ (temples) and held at the temples precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article1175873.ece |title=Police move against cockfight faces opposition|work= [[The Hindu]] |date=January 10, 2008| accessdate=May 24, 2017|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2012 at India's 'Sun God' Festival the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) district committee, demanded that police not interfere in the cockfighting known as ‘kozhi kettu’ as it is a part of the [[temple]] [[rituals]], while the police replied they would not interfere if the cockfight is held at a temple.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, Denise A (January 9, 2012). &quot;Cockfighting and Gambling Dominate India's 'Sun God' Festival&quot;.

Cockfighting is a very old [[tradition]] in [[Balinese Hinduism]], the Batur Bang Inscriptions I (from the year 933) and the Batuan Inscription (dated 944 on the Balinese Caka calendar) disclose that the ''tabuh rah'' ritual has existed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/01/23/bali039s-cockfighting-tradition-lives.html |title=Bali-Cockfighting Tradition Lives |work=The Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |publisher=Thejakartapost.com |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2014-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225114512/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/01/23/bali039s-cockfighting-tradition-lives.html |archivedate=2014-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bali]], cockfights, known as ''tajen'', are practiced in an ancient religious purification [[ritual]] to expel evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Bali Today: Love and social life, By Jean Couteau, Jean Couteau et al., p128-129, Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual, a form of [[animal sacrifice]], is called ''tabuh rah'' (&quot;pouring blood&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Bali, Sekala and Niskala: Essays on society, tradition, and craft, Fred B. Eiseman – page 240 – Periplus Editions, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of tabuh rah is to provide an offering (the blood of the losing chicken) to the evil spirits. Cockfighting is a religious obligation at every Balinese temple festival or religious ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Bali, Sekala and Niskala, Vol. 2: Essays on Society, Tradition, and Craft, Fred B. Eiseman Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; Cockfights without a religious purpose are considered [[gambling]] in Indonesia, although it is still largely practiced in many parts of Indonesia. Women are generally not involved in the tabuh rah process. The tabuh rah process is held on the largest pavilion in a Balinese temple complex, the [[wantilan]].

The American anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] published his most famous work, ''[[Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight|Notes on the Balinese Cockfight]]'', on the practice of cockfights in Bali. In it, he argued that the cockfight served as a pastiche or model of wider Balinese society from which judgments about other aspects of the culture could be drawn.

==== Iraq ====
[[File:Cock fighting in رAfghanistan.jpg|thumb|Cockfight on the outskirts of [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]]]
Cockfighting is illegal but widespread in Iraq. The attendees come to gamble or just for the entertainment. A rooster can cost up to $8,000.

Cockfighting was introduced to Japan from China in the early 8th century and rose to popularity in the [[Kamakura period]] and the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frédéric&quot;&gt;Louis Frédéric, ''Japan Encyclopedia'' (trans.

Cockfighting is a popular sport in rural Pakistan; however, &quot;betting is illegal under the Prevention of Gambling Act 1977&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/01/10/city/islamabad/cockfight-signifies-cruel-culture/ |title=Cockfight signifies cruel culture – Thursday, 26 July 2012 |publisher=Pakistantoday.com.pk |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betting is illegal, but police often turn a blind eye towards it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[Sindh]] (one of 4 major [[provinces of Pakistan]]), people are fond of keeping fighting cock breed, known as ''[[Asil chicken#Sindhi Aseel|Sindhi aseel]]'' in [[Pakistan]]. These cocks are noted being tall, heavy and good at fighting. Another popular breed is called [[Mianwali]] Aseel. In ''Sindh'' [[Gambling|Gamblor or Khafti]] uses [[Almond]] and other power enhancing medicines to feed the fighter cocks.

==== Philippines ====

Cockfighting, locally termed ''sabong'', is a popular pastime in the [[Philippines]], where both illegal and legal cockfights occur. Legal cockfights are held in cockpits every week, whilst illegal ones, called ''tupada'' or ''tigbakay'', are held in secluded cockpits where authorities cannot raid them. In both types, knives or ''gaffs'' are used. There are two kinds of knives used in Philippine cockfighting: single-edged blades (used in derbies) and double-edged blades; lengths of knives also vary. All knives are attached on the left leg of the bird, but depending on agreement between owners, blades can be attached on the right or even on both legs. ''Sabong'' and illegal ''tupada'', are judged by a referee called ''sentensyador'' or ''koyme'', whose verdict is final and not subject to any appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25601/Emergency-'Sentensyador' |title=Emergency: 'Sentensyador' |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2014-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403020911/http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25601/Emergency-'Sentensyador' |archivedate=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bets are usually taken by the ''kristo'', so named because of his outstretched hands when calling out wagers from the audience and skillfully doing so purely from memory.
[[File:MetroManilajf1612 41.JPG|thumb|World Gamefowl Expo 2014, World Trade Center [[Metro Manila]]]]

The country has hosted several ''World Slasher Cup'' derbies, held biannually at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], [[Quezon City]], where the world's leading game fowl breeders gather. World Slasher Cup is also known as the &quot;Olympics of Cockfighting&quot;. The [[Commons:Category:World Gamefowl Expo 2014|World Gamefowl Expo 2014]] was held in the World Trade Center [[Metro Manila]].

Cockfighting was already flourishing in pre-colonial Philippines, as recorded by [[Antonio Pigafetta]], the Italian diarist aboard [[Ferdinand Magellan]]’s 1521 expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dundes|first=Alan|title=The Cockfight: A Casebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy5VqKSYt8IC|year=1994|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-14054-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy5VqKSYt8IC&amp;pg=PA137 137]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cockfighting in the Philippines is derived from the fact that it shares elements of Indian and other Southeast Asian cultures, where the jungle fowl (bankivoid) and Oriental type of chicken are endemic.

==== Cuba ====
Cockfighting was so common during the Cuban colonization by [[Spain]] that there were arenas in every urban and rural town. The first official known document about cockfighting in Cuba dates from 1737. It is a royal decree asking, to the governor of the island, a report about the inconveniences that might cause cockfights &quot;with the people from land and sea&quot; and asking for information about rentals of the games. The Spaniard [[Miguel Tacón y Rosique|Miguel Tacón]], Lieutenant General and governor of the colony, banned cockfighting by a decree dated on October 20, 1835, limiting these spectacles only to holidays.

In 1844, a decree dictated by the Captain General of the island, [[Leopoldo O'Donnell]], forbade to non-white people the attendance to these shows. During the second half of the 19th century, many authorizations were conceded for building arenas, until General [[Juan Rius Rivera]], then civilian governor in Havana, prohibited cockfighting by a decree of October 31, 1899, and later the Cuban governor, General [[Leonard Wood]], dictated the military order no. 165 prohibiting cockfights in the whole country since June 1, 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;pupo&quot;&gt;Agustín Pupo Domenech, El Gallo Fino Cubano, 151 pp. Editorial SI-MAR, S.A., La Habana, Cuba 1995 ({{ISBN|9597054051}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, legality of cockfights suffered several ups and downs.&lt;ref&gt;Revista Carteles, September 2, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, the then-Cuban president [[José Miguel Gómez]], with the intention to gain followers, allowed cockfights once again, and then regulations were agreed for the fights.&lt;ref&gt;Reglamento para las lidias de gallos, Ayuntamiento de Holguín, Cuba 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the beginning of 1968, cockfights used to be held everywhere in the country, but with the purpose of stopping the bets, the arenas were closed and the fights forbidden by the authorities. In 1980, authorities legalized cockfights again and a state business organization was created with the participation of the private breeders, grouped in territories. Every year the state organization announces several national tournaments from January to April, makes trade shows and sells fighting cocks to clients from other Caribbean countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pupo&quot; /&gt;

==== Dominican Republic ====
In the Dominican Republic, cockfighting is both legal and very popular. There is at least one arena (''gallera)'' in every town, whereas in bigger cities larger ''coliseos'' can be found.  Important fights are broadcast on television and newspapers have dedicated pages to cockfights and the different ''trabas'', the local name for gamefowl breeding grounds. Those dedicated to the breeding and training of fighting cocks are called ''galleros''  or ''traberos''. The cocks are often outfitted with special spurs made from various materials (ranging from plastic to metal or even [[Hawksbill sea turtle|carey]] shell)  and fights are typically to the death. Public perception of the sport is as normal as that of baseball or any other major sport.

==== United States ====

Cockfighting is illegal in all 50 [[U.S. state]]s and the [[District of Columbia]]. The last state to implement a [[State law (United States)|state law]] banning cockfighting was [[Louisiana]]; the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] voted to approve a ban in June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=6493974 |title=Louisiana State House passes Cockfighting ban |publisher=Wafb.com |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525171023/http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=6493974 |archive-date=2009-05-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; which went into effect in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/lavoz/spanish/us/articles/us_123936.html Legisladores de Luisiana aprueban prohibición a pelea de gallos] June 27, 2007 [[La Voz (Phoenix)|La Voz]] {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The possession of cockfighting implements is prohibited in 15 states.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013Chart&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, the [[Agricultural Act of 2014|2014 farm bill]], signed into law by President Obama, contained a provision making it a federal crime to attend an animal fighting event or bring a child under the age of 16 to an animal fighting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HSLF |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news_briefs/2014/02/farm_bill_passed_020414.html|title=Farm Bill Strengthens Animal Fighting Law, Maintains State Farm Animal Protection Laws|publisher=Humane Society of the United States|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cockfighting ban was further extended by federal law to include U.S. territories—American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—effective at the end of 2019, as signed into law in the [[2018 United States farm bill|2018 farm bill]] by President Trump.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Perez, &quot;Cockfighting Ban Now Law&quot;, [https://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/cockfighting-ban-now-law/ Saipan Tribune], 24 December 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Puerto Rico]], cockfighting is popular and has been considered a &quot;national sport&quot; since at least the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trove 1953&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Cock-fighting in Puerto Rico |newspaper=Townsville Daily Bulletin (Qld. : 1907–1954) | date=4 May 1953 | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62475942 | access-date=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[National Park Service]] report, it generates about $100 million annually.

The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, a [[federal law]] that made it a federal crime to transfer cockfighting implements across [[Commerce Clause|state or national borders]] and increasing the penalty for violations of federal animal fighting laws to three years in prison, became law in 2007. It passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] 368–39 and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by [[unanimous consent]] and was signed into law by President [[George W.

The [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] was amended again in 2008 when provisions were included in the [[2008 Farm Bill]] (P.L. 110-246). These provisions tightened prohibitions on dog and other animal fighting activities, and increased penalties for violations of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RS22493.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426032912/http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RS22493.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-26 }} The Animal Welfare Act: Background and Selected Legislation by Tadlock Cowan – Analyst in Natural Resources and Rural Development – September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
