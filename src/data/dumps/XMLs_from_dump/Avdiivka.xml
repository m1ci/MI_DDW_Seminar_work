'''Avdiivka''' ({{Lang-uk|Авдіївка}}, {{IPA-uk|ɐu̯ˈd⁽ʲ⁾ijiu̯kɐ|pron}}) or '''Avdeevka''' ({{Lang-ru|link=no|Авдеевка}}) is a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] in [[Donetsk Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of [[Ukraine]]. The city is located in center of the region just north from the city of [[Donetsk]]. Avdiivka is best known for its big [[Avdiivka Coke Plant]]. Officially the town's population is {{Ua-pop-est2013|35,128}}; in January 2017 [[BBC News]] estimated that the population ranged between 16,000 and 22,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABBC30116&quot;/&gt;

In March 2016 the [[Ukrainian army]] set up its fortifications in the area &quot;Industrial Zone&quot;, until then a buffer zone between the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] controlled territories and Ukrainian army controlled Ukraine located in the eastern part Avdiivka.&lt;ref name=&quot;wAfi31117&quot;/&gt; This meant that the pro-Russian separatists no longer had full control of the highway that united their controlled cities [[Donetsk]] and [[Horlivka]] and that it became more difficult for them to fire at Avdiivka with weapons not prohibited by the [[Minsk II]] agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;wAfi31117&quot;/&gt; Since March 2016 fighting for Avdiivka's &quot;Industrial Zone&quot; greatly  intensified.&lt;ref name=&quot;wAfi31117&quot;&gt;{{in lang|uk}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/articles/id_7134026/ Freeze on fire. What happens in Avdiyivka?], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (31 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 29 January 2017 until 4 February 2017 the city was embroiled in the [[Battle of Avdiivka]] which left Avdiivka without electricity and heating for several days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/avdiivka-frontline-ukraine-war-russia-backed-separatists Violence flares in war-weary Ukraine as US dithers and Russia pounces], [[The Guardian]] (14 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |quote=An AFP reporter saw the separatists shell the town of about 20,000 people with repeated rounds of Grad multiple rocket systems and artillery fire from the early morning. &quot;Right now, there is no power. We have not resolved problems with heating homes, and the gas pipe has been shattered,&quot; local Ukrainian army unit spokeswoman Olena Mokrynchuk told AFP [...] The town's heating is provided by a coke plant that has been heavily damaged by the falling shells. Plant director Musa Magomedov said it would be incredibly difficult to resume gas production were the factory's generators shut down. That would leave Avdiivka without a source of local power and uncertainty about its future. |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |title=Ukraine clashes rage for third day, sparking EU concern |date=January 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131164143/https://www.afp.com/en/news/23/ukraine-clashes-rage-third-day-sparking-eu-concern |url=https://www.afp.com/en/news/23/ukraine-clashes-rage-third-day-sparking-eu-concern |archive-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7134509/ In Avdiyivka switched to heating mode stable&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry and infrastructure==
Heating energy is normally provided via [[natural gas]] from the [[Avdiivka Coke Plant]].  The plant was damaged and its gas pipe shattered during a bombardment by pro-Russian separatists in January 2017, leaving the town without heating for several days.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

Beside Avdiivka Coke, the city has Avdiivka Factory of Metallic Structures, [[quartz sand]] quarry and some other factories and industrial centers.

The city had [[Trams in Avdiivka|its own tramway service]] which connects the city's center with Avdiivka Coke Plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avdiivka Tram&quot;/&gt; Due to the [[War in Donbass]] it is no longer operating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avdiivka Tram&quot;&gt;{{in lang|uk}} [https://life.informator.news/avdiivs-ky-tramva-nedootsinena-lehenda-promyslovoho-transportu-svitovoho-masshtabu/# Avdeevsky tram. Inexpensive legend of world-class industrial transport], [[Informator]] (20 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The line had three rail stops&lt;ref name=&quot;Avdiivka Tram&quot;/&gt; and the city train station.

The city is conditionally split by a railroad into Old city and settlement &quot;Khimik&quot; (literally: Chemist).
