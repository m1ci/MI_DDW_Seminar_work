{{main|Adalaj Stepwell}}
The [[Adalaj Stepwell]] is a popular tourist attraction of the city and is situated {{Convert|18|km}} away from '''Ghandhinagar'''. The well was built in 1499 A.D. by Queen Rudabai. The step well or Vav, as it is called in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], is intricately carved and is several stories deep. The carvings on its walls and pillars include leaves, flowers, birds, fish, geometrical patterns, and other breathtaking ornamental designs. In the past, these step wells were frequented by travellers and caravans as stopovers along trade routes.

This vav has five stories and three gates to enter it. On entering, one is  greeted by one mandap with an eight-sided dome, which is now damaged. On both sides of steps are balconies with beautiful carvings. Rows of carved elephants mark some of the levels.
