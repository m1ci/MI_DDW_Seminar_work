'''Bhawana''' (also spelled as '''Bhowana''') ({{lang-ur|{{URDU|بھوانہ}}}}, {{lang-pa|{{Punjabi|بھوآنہ}}}}) is the capital of [[Bhawana Tehsil|Bhawana tehsil]] and a city in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It is located on the bank of the [[Chenab River|Chenab river]], bounded by [[Faisalabad]], [[Jhang]], and [[Chiniot]], three other cities in Punjab.

== History ==
Bhawana is one of the ancient cities of Pakistan. The [[Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur|Zahir-ud-din Babur]] also mentions the area in his book the ''Tuzk-e-Babari''{{CN|date=November 2015}} for its fine architecture and finely handcrafted [[jharoka]] windows of many of the old ''havelis'' (manors) and other buildings of the old/medieval town.

== Geography and climate ==
Bhawana is located by the side of [[Jhang-Chiniot Road|Jhang Chiniot road]] and on the left bank of the Chenab river.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=Cao_HfROWtNAFT2Y4QEdAmlUBCkLAQUUtcsjOTEFq5PizOM2SA&amp;q=Bhowana,+Punjab,+Pakistan&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=31.562301,72.647352&amp;sspn=0.018722,0.027595&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bhowana,+Jhang,+Punjab,+Pakistan&amp;lci=org.wikipedia.en&amp;ll=31.563142,72.646322&amp;spn=0.018722,0.027595&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A Location of Bhawana on Google Map]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, with a  budget of 250 million rupees, a bridge from Bhawana to Kalri has been constructed over the Chenab river. Leaders of opposition political parties specially Imran Khan and Billawal Bhutto have criticised the Chief Minister Punjab Shabaz Sharif for spending such a huge amount on a bridge to benefit CM' owned Ramzan Sugar Mills.{{CN|date=May 2016}} Its soil is very fertile and is among the largest agricultural areas,{{Clarify|date=November 2015}} and the city itself also depends considerably on [[agriculture]] to bolster its economy. It is situated 37&amp;nbsp;km from Chiniot, 50&amp;nbsp;km from [[Faisalabad]], 48&amp;nbsp;km from [[Jhang]] and 70&amp;nbsp;km from [[Sargodha]]. Its weather is much like the rest of Pakistan's, with summer, spring, winter and autumn seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weathercity.com/pk/pb/bhawana/ Check weather report for Bhawana]&lt;/ref&gt; Its temperatures are usually moderate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelingluck.com/Asia/Pakistan/Punjab/_1182682_Bhaw%C4%81na.html#local_map Location and Climate]&lt;/ref&gt;
