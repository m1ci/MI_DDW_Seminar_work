Born on August 18, 1988,&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2014&quot;/&gt; and raised in Seoul, Kwon Ji-yong began his career at age six as part of the group Little Roo'Ra.&lt;ref name=&quot;新스타고백 지드래곤③연습생시절, 1년간 죽어라 청소만&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kr.news.yahoo.com/service/news/shellview.htm?articleid=20100129080000379f3&amp;linkid=4&amp;newssetid=1352 |script-title=ko::新스타고백 지드래곤③연습생시절, 1년간 죽어라 청소만|last=Park|first=So-Youn|date=March 1, 2006|work=Yahoo Korean News|publisher=Yahoo!|language=ko|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091917/http://kr.news.yahoo.com/service/news/shellview.htm?articleid=20100129080000379f3&amp;linkid=4&amp;newssetid=1352|archivedate=February 4, 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing a Christmas album, the group's contract was terminated by their record company, which came as a &quot;shock&quot; to G-Dragon. Although he vowed to his mother that he &quot;wouldn't [try to become a singer] again,&quot; he was scouted by [[SM Entertainment]] while on a ski trip with his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;'준비된 그룹' 빅뱅, 대폭발 예고&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.chosun.com/news/news.htm?name=/news/entertainment/200607/20060708/67h18001.htm |script-title=ko:'준비된 그룹' 빅뱅, 대폭발 예고|last=Kim|first=So-Ra|date=July 7, 2006|work=Sports Chosun|accessdate=January 15, 2010|publisher=Chosun Ilbo|author2=|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a trainee under the record label for five years (from 8–13 years old), specializing in dance before he left.&lt;ref name=&quot;新스타고백 지드래곤③연습생시절, 1년간 죽어라 청소만&quot;/&gt;

In third grade, Kwon was introduced to the American rap group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] by a friend. Inspired by their music, he developed an interest in rapping and began taking classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;新스타고백 지드래곤③연습생시절, 1년간 죽어라 청소만&quot;/&gt; Under People Crew's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ko:[新스타고백]지드래곤③연습생시절, 1년간 죽어라 청소만|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010011509423575917|website=asiae.co.kr|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; tutelage, he participated in the release of the Korean hip-hop album ''Flex'' in 2001, becoming the youngest Korean rapper at 13 years old. Although he wrote his own lyrics, he admitted that his English was weak and the story behind the lyrics was just another typical &quot;I'm young, but I'm the best&quot; story.&lt;ref name=&quot;新스타고백 지드래곤③연습생시절, 1년간 죽어라 청소만&quot;/&gt; Additionally, he and future fellow Big Bang member [[T.O.P (rapper)|Choi Seung-hyun]] were &quot;neighborhood friend[s] from middle school&quot; and would often dance and rap together before Kwon moved away.&lt;ref name=&quot;dance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010012610365249416|date=February 2, 2010|publisher=Asiae News|language=ko|script-title=ko:新스타고백지드래곤⑤아이돌그룹 활동, 망설였다|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catching the interest of Sean of the hip-hop duo [[Jinusean]] from [[YG Entertainment]], Kwon was recommended by him to Sean's record label's CEO [[Yang Hyun Suk]]. After signing a contract with the record label, Kwon spent the first year cleaning the studio for the other artists in the record label and fetching them water bottles during dance practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;新스타고백 지드래곤③연습생시절, 1년간 죽어라 청소만&quot;/&gt;

Kwon and another trainee, [[Taeyang|Dong Young-bae]], originally planned to debut as the hip hop duo [[GD X TAEYANG|GDYB]], with Kwon choosing the stage name of G-Dragon (&quot;Ji&quot; is pronounced like &quot;G&quot;, and Yong is Korean for &quot;dragon&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;'준비된 그룹' 빅뱅, 대폭발 예고&quot;/&gt; He made several featured appearances on other artists' albums and even released several singles with Dong under the name &quot;GDYB.&quot; After YG Entertainment scrapped the plan and opted for a boy band instead, Kwon contacted Choi, who auditioned in.&lt;ref name=&quot;dance&quot; /&gt; G-Dragon, Dong (who chose the stage name Taeyang), and Choi (who chose the stage name T.O.P), were paired with three other members ([[Jang Hyun-seung]], [[Daesung]], and [[Seungri]]).
