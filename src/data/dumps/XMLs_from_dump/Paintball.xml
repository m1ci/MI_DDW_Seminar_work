'''Paintball''' is a [[competitive sport|competitive]] [[team sport|team]] [[shooting sport]] in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical [[dye]]-filled [[gelatin]] capsules (&quot;[[Paintball equipment#Paintballs|paintballs]]&quot;) that break upon impact. Paintballs are usually shot using a low-energy [[air gun|air weapon]] called a [[paintball marker]] that is powered by [[compressed air]] ([[nitrogen]]) or [[carbon dioxide]] and was originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nicolpawn.ca/paintball-blog.php/2011/05/27/history-of-paintball-markers|title=Paintball History &gt; First Paintball Game|website=nicolpawn.ca|access-date=2019-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was initially developed in May 1981&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; by Hayes Noel (a Wall Street stock trader) and Charles Gaines (an avid outdoorsman and writer). Best friends, Noel and Gaines argued about who would be better suited for survival, a city dweller who knew how people's minds worked (Noel) or a man who had spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins in the woods (Gaines). The two men chanced upon an advertisement for a paint gun and were inspired to settle their argument with paintball markers, eventually creating the sport that is now called Paintball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/magazine/who-made-that-paintball.html|title=Who Made That Paintball?|last=Slater|first=Dashka|date=2014-08-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport is  played for [[recreation]] and is also played at a formal sporting level with organized competition that involves major tournaments, professional teams, and players.&lt;ref name=&quot;tasmanianews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/09/09/96241_tasmania-news.html|title=Push to legalise paintball|accessdate=October 31, 2014|date=September 9, 2009|publisher=The Mercury|last = Brown|first = Damien|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112533/http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/09/09/96241_tasmania-news.html|archivedate = July 6, 2011|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/113363/sporting-goods-group-dissects-team-sports.html|title=Sporting Goods Group Dissects Team Sports|accessdate=October 31, 2014|date=September 11, 2009|publisher=MediaPost Communications|last = Greenberg|first = Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintball technology is also used by military forces, law enforcement, [[paramilitary]] and security organizations to supplement [[military training|military or other training]]. Paintball markers can play a role in [[Riot control|riot response]] and [[Nonlethal force|nonlethal suppression]] of dangerous suspects.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Games can be played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying sizes. A game field is scattered with natural or artificial [[terrain]], which players use for [[Military tactics|tactical cover]]. Game types and goals vary, but may include [[capture the flag]], elimination, &lt;!-- limited ammunition --&gt;defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from minutes to hours, or even days in &quot;scenario play&quot;.

The legality of paintball varies among countries and regions. In most areas where regulated play is offered, players are required to wear protective masks, use barrel blocking safety equipment, and safe game rules are strictly enforced.

==Equipment==
{{Main|Paintball equipment}}
[[File:JTF3 wood-simulation.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|Players with woodsball equipment]]

The [[paintball equipment]] used may depend on the game type, for example: [[woodsball]], [[speedball (paintball)|speedball]], or [[scenario paintball|scenario]]; on how much money one is willing to spend on equipment; and personal preference. However, almost every player will utilize three basic pieces of equipment:
* [[Paintball marker]]: also known as a &quot;paintball gun&quot;, this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the opposing player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a [[Paintball equipment#Hoppers/Loaders|loader or &quot;hopper&quot;]] or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a [[compressed air]] tank or [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable silver capsules ({{convert|12|g|adj=on}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridges) normally seen in pellet guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How semi-automatic paintball guns work (animation)|url=http://www.mayhem-paintball.co.uk/news/how-semi-automatic-paintball-guns-work|website = mayhem-paintball.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paintball X3: Auto-cockers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=121:the-80s-part-22-auto-cockers&amp;catid=35:the-the-game-a-industry&amp;Itemid=2 |title=The 80s Part 25: Auto-cockers |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |publisher=Paintball X3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410080914/http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=121%3Athe-80s-part-22-auto-cockers&amp;catid=35%3Athe-the-game-a-industry&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paintball X3: Gear History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=174&amp;Itemid=58 |title=Gear History 1981-2000 |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |author=Davidson, Steve |publisher=Paintball X3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305210633/http://history.paintballx3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=174&amp;Itemid=58 |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further improvements included increased rates of fire; [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) tanks from 100 to 1,180 ml (3.5 to 40 US fluid ounces), and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 34,000 kPa (5,000 psi). The use of unstable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers.
* [[Paintball equipment#Paintballs|Paintballs]] (pellets): Paintballs, the [[ammunition]] used in the marker, are spherical [[gelatin]] [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] containing primarily [[polyethylene glycol]], other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs is dependent on the brittleness of the ball's shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. The highest-grade paintballs incorporate cornstarch and metallic flake into the fill to leave a thick glittery &quot;splat&quot; that is very obvious against any background color, and hard to wipe off. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradeable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment. Manufacturers and distributors have been making the effort to move away from the traditional oil-based paints and compressed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas propellant, to a more friendly water-based formula and compressed air in an effort to become more &quot;eco-friendly&quot;. Paintballs come in a variety of sizes, including of 13mm (0.50 in) and 17mm (0.68in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bzpaintball.co.uk/blog/the-different-grades-of-paint/|title=The Different Grades Of Paintballs|last=BZ Paintball|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paintball equipment#Masks|Mask or goggles]]: Masks are safety devices players are required to wear at all times on the field, to protect them from paintballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theorion.com/features/aiming-to-please-paintball-club-geared-toward-beginners-1.347002|title=Aiming to please: Paintball Club geared toward beginners|accessdate=October 31, 2014|date=September 2, 2009|publisher=The Orion|last = Barrett|first = Lindsey|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907165905/http://www.theorion.com/features/aiming-to-please-paintball-club-geared-toward-beginners-1.347002|archivedate = September 7, 2009|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original equipment used by players were safety goggles of the type used in labs and wood shops; today's goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or ear protection for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues.

Additional equipment, commonly seen among frequent players, tournament participants, and professional players include:
* Pods and pod packs: The most common addition to the above &quot;mandatory&quot; equipment, ''pods'' are plastic containers, usually with flip-open lids, that store paintballs in a ready-to-use manner. Pods are available in many sizes, including 10, 80, 100 and 140-round sizes, with the larger 140-round pods being most common among tournament players. Pods are carried by the player in ''pod packs'' or ''harnesses'' which facilitate easy access to the pods during play. There are several designs of pod packs, from belt loops allowing a recreational player to carry one or two extra pods, to harness designs generally designed for either tournament-style or scenario-style players.
* [[Squeegee]]/swab – From time to time, a paintball will break inside the player's marker. When this happens it coats the inner surfaces of the marker with paint, especially the barrel, which considerably reduces accuracy. While speedball and tournament players generally have no time to clear this obstruction and instead simply &quot;shoot through it&quot;, woodsball and scenario players generally carry a tool to allow them to clear the barrel following a break. There are several types of squeegee, most of which are advantageous in two of three areas and disadvantageous in the last: cleaning time, effectiveness, and storage space.
* Paintball jerseys and pants: Originally derived from motocross and BMX attire, tournament players commonly wear special outer clothing with integrated padding that allows the player a free range of motion, and helps protect the player both from paintball hits and from incidental contact with rocks and hard ground. Certain designs of jersey and pant even advertise lower incidence of hits, due to increased &quot;bounce-offs&quot; and &quot;breakaways&quot;. In indoor fields, where shooting generally happens at very close range, hard-shelled armor is sometimes worn to protect the player from bruising and welts from close-range hits.
* Elbow and knee pads: Common among outdoor sports, players can choose to help protect knee, elbow and even hip joints from jarring impact with the use of pads. For paintball, these pads are generally soft foam worn inside a player's pants to prevent abrasion of the pad against the ground.
* Gloves: Paintball impacts to the hands, knuckles and fingers can be extremely painful and temporarily debilitating. In addition, this being an outdoor sport, players are often prone or crawling which can cause scrapes to the hands. Padded or armored gloves help reduce the potential for injury to the hands from these things.
* [[jockstrap|Athletic supporter]]: Also called a jockstrap with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]. Also common in other sports involving potential impact of fast-moving objects, players generally take care to protect sensitive or vulnerable anatomical areas from painful hits and injury; men commonly wear an athletic supporter with a rigid cup similar to types used in football, lacrosse, hockey or baseball, while women often wear a pelvic protector and a padded or hard-shelled sports bra also commonly seen in the aforementioned sports.
* Other paint marking equipment: Normally seen in scenario play only, and disallowed at all tournaments, other forms of paint-marking equipment are sold, such as paint-grenades (paint-filled balloons or lengths of surgical hose).
* Vehicles: Again normally only seen in scenario play, a variety of vehicles have been devised based on go-karts, pickup trucks, ATVs, small off-road vehicles, etc. to create &quot;armored vehicles&quot;, within which players are protected from hits and can move around on the field. Such vehicles may employ a wide range of mounted paint-discharging weaponry.
* Hats/Toques/Bandanas: Commonly worn by all levels of players to protect the forehead from direct paintball hits, and stop sweat from running down in to the mask.
* Remote lines: Used to increase maneuverability, a remote line is a high- pressure hose connecting the fuel tank to the marker allowing the tank to be stored in a backpack or harness. It is mostly found in Mil-Sim, woodsball and scenario events.

== Gameplay ==
Paintball is played with a potentially limitless [[Paintball variations|variety of rules and variations]], which are specified before the game begins. The most basic game rule is that players must attempt to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball. A variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from &quot;anything counts&quot; (hits cause elimination whether the paintball broke and left a mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and leave a mark the size of a US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing team points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zb4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ej4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6957,13377142&amp;dq=basic+paintball+rules|title=Paintball Planet features competitive fun|publisher=Cherokee County Herald|accessdate=September 16, 2009|author=McCarthy, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paintball-apl.com/APL%202003%20Rules%2004-03-03.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030502081811/http://www.paintball-apl.com/APL%202003%20Rules%2004-03-03.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 2, 2003 |title=APL Rules |accessdate=July 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player may return to the field and continue playing, or is eliminated from the game completely.

The particular goal of the game is determined before play begins; examples include ''[[capture the flag]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/20/business/the-executive-life-the-satisfying-silliness-of-the-paintball-wars.html|title=The Executive Life; The Satisfying Silliness Of the Paintball Wars|accessdate=September 15, 2009|author=Billard, Mary|date=October 20, 1991|publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Elimination''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/01/13/indoor_paintball_site_targets_the_rapid_growth_of_sport/|title=Indoor paintball site targets the rapid growth of sport|accessdate=September 15, 2009|date=January 13, 2005|author=Ewing, Bill|newspaper=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintball has spawned popular variants, including [[woodsball]], which is played in the natural environment and spans across a large area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dennews.com/media/storage/paper309/news/2007/09/28/TheVerge/Paintball.Addictive.To.Players-2998458.shtml|publisher=The Daily Eastern News|title=Paintball addictive to players|author=Peters, Kristina|accessdate=September 15, 2009|date=September 28, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023010928/http://media.www.dennews.com/media/storage/paper309/news/2007/09/28/TheVerge/Paintball.Addictive.To.Players-2998458.shtml|archivedate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the variant of [[speedball (paintball)|speedball]] is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace with games as brief as two minutes fifteen seconds in the (NSL) or lasting up to twenty minutes in the PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2006-07-07/Sports/020.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126150440/http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2006-07-07/Sports/020.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 26, 2010|title=Paintball's popularity continues to spread|accessdate=April 7, 2010|author=Gase, Thomas|publisher=Simi Valley Acorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant is [[scenario paintball]], in which players attempt to recreate historical, or fictional settings; the largest being [[Oklahoma D-Day]]'s [[World War II]] [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Woodsball ===
{{Main|Woodsball}}
Woodsball or &quot;Bushball&quot;, is a term developed late in the history of the game&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prospaintball.com/history-of-paintball/|title=The Complete History of Paintball - Everything We Know!|date=2019-08-31|website=ProsPaintball.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to what was the original form of the game: teams competing in a wooded or natural environment, in which varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario-based play, but it technically refers to virtually any form of paintball played in fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and berms, instead of manmade obstacles.

=== Scenario ===
{{Main|Scenario paintball}}
Woodsball may feature large or small teams, in competition to obtain various goals and objectives. Large-scale Woodsball games are commonly referred to as &quot;Big Games&quot; or &quot;Scenario Games&quot;. Popular examples of the scenario format are Cousin's Big Game in Coram, New York (on Long Island), Hell Survivor's Monster Game (just outside Pinckney, Michigan), Invasion of Normandy at Skirmish U.S.A in Pennsylvania, [[Oklahoma D-Day]] (in Wyandotte, Oklahoma), Fight For Asylum at PRZ Paintball (Picton, Ontario), and Battle Royale at Flag Raiders Paintball (Kitchener, Ontario), events which draws in 2,000 to 4,500 players and last for two days, up to a week. Another variant of the Big Game is the &quot;Attack and Defend&quot; format where large numbers of attackers try to overrun a fixed, but a well-defended objective, such as a compound or large building.

=== MilSim ===
[[MilSim]] (&quot;Military Simulation&quot;) is a mode of play designed to create an experience closer to military reality, where the attainment of specific objectives is the most important aspect of the game.

MilSim addresses the logistics of combat, mission planning and execution, and dealing with limited resources and ammunition. Players are typically eliminated from the game when struck by paint. For aesthetic reasons, MilSim often uses [[airsoft gun]]s rather than paintball guns, as their prominent hoppers appear unrealistic, however Airsoft pellets, being smaller caliber and fired at higher velocity, have an increased risk of player injury if the scenario involves high rates of fire or close range.

With the advent of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the resulting development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained.  Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no different than any other paintball marker, with one exception.  Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine from the bottom of the marker.  The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same.  The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which in turn has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSiM environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airsplat.com/MilSim|title=Airsoft MilSim - Military Simulation|website=www.airsplat.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speedball ===
{{Main|Speedball (paintball)}}
Speedball is played in an open field that could be compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some &quot;give&quot; to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric &quot;bunkers&quot; were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as &quot;snake&quot; and &quot;can&quot; bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more &quot;High Tech&quot; in a sense that they are controlled by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).

=== Concept ===
Concept Fields have many objects set up to allow players to remain hidden from their opponents. A concept field is a perfect man-made creation for paintball games. A field in this style is usually outdoors and almost always has a theme. There are a small amount of indoor fields, some have a theme, some speedball and some with a blend of woodsball game play in an indoor environment. Urban concept fields are often seen filled with cars, buildings, and other elements that are found in the city, though some concept field creators go all out and put together themes that may seem a bit over the top to those who aren't familiar with the sport.&lt;ref&gt;Concept Field {{cite web| url=http://www.grippaintball.com/best-paintball-guns/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219030953/http://www.grippaintball.com/best-paintball-guns/| url-status=dead| archive-date=2017-02-19| title=Grip Paintball}} February 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enforcement of game rules ===
Regulated games are overseen by [[referees]] or [[marshals]], who patrol the course to ensure enforcement of the rules and the safety of the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paintball Risk Assessement|url=http://www.mayhem-paintball.co.uk/about/Risk%20Assessement%20for%20Mayhem%20Paintballing%20London}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a player is marked with paint, they will call them out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the [[honor code]]; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=140&amp;article=27733|title=Paintball warriors embrace fast and furious version known as 'speedball'|accessdate=March 20, 2010 |author=Zimmerman, Fred|publisher=Stars and Stripes|date=March 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating.
* '''Masks On''' Even when a game isn't in progress, virtually all venues enforce a ''masks-on'' rule while players are within the playing area. More generally, within any given area of the park, either all players'/spectators'/officials' masks must be on, or all players' markers must either have a barrel block in place or be disconnected from their gas source, to ensure that a paintball cannot be fired from any nearby marker and cause eye injury. Some fields encourage players to aim away from opponents' heads during play if possible; splatter from mask hits can penetrate ventilation holes in the goggles and cause eye irritation, close-range hits to the mask can cause improperly maintained lenses to fail, and hits to unprotected areas of the face, head and neck are especially painful and can cause more serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;Paintball Shooting Tactics at ExtremeSports101 - ''Getting a head shot looks cool and because there’s so much hard surface, there’s a good chance that the paint will break. However, there are definite downsides to going for an opponent’s head. There’s also a good chance that the player will end up eating some paint or - worse yet - get hit in the neck, which is quite painful. If players don’t change their lenses as often as they should (and few players do!), a hit to the lenses may cause them to break.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Minimum distance''' – When being tagged, depending on the distance from where the shot was fired, a direct paintball impact commonly causes bruises. In certain areas and at close range, these impacts may leave welts, or even break the skin and cause bleeding. To decrease these risks and the severity of associated injuries, commercial venues may enforce a minimum distance rule; such as {{convert|4.5|m|ft}}, whereby players cannot shoot an opponent if they are closer than this distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;roanoke&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/sports\wb/83060|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201085529/http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/sports%5Cwb/83060|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 1, 2013|title=Paintball: There's a little pain, but it's a ball|author=Fowler, Hart|accessdate=September 18, 2009|newspaper=The Roanoke Times|date=September 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fields enforce a modified minimum distance ''surrender rule''; a player who advances to within minimum range must offer his opponent the chance to surrender before shooting. This generally prevents injury and discord at recreational games, however it is seldom used in tournaments as it confers a real disadvantage to the attacking player; he must hesitate while his opponent is free to shoot immediately. The act of shooting a player at close range is colloquially called &quot;bunkering&quot;; it happens most often when a player uses covering fire to force his opponent behind the cover of a bunker, then advances on that bunker while still shooting to eliminate the opponent point-blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directpaintball.com/article_bunkering101.html |title=Bunkering 101 - Tactics and the Surrender Rule |publisher=Directpaintball.com |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tap of the targeted player with the barrel of a marker, sometimes called a &quot;barrel tag&quot;, &quot;Murphy&quot; or &quot;tap-out&quot;, is generally considered equivalent to marking them with a paintball and is sometimes used in situations where one player is able to sneak up on an opponent to point-blank range.
* '''Hits''' - A player is hit if a paintball leaves a solid mark of a specified minimum size (often nickel- or quarter-sized) anywhere on the player's body or equipment. Some variations of paintball don't count hits to the gun or the pod pack, or require multiple hits on the arms or legs. Most professional fields and tournaments, though, count any hit on a person, the equipment on his person, or even objects picked up at random from the field. A grey area of &quot;splatter&quot; often occurs when a paintball breaks on a nearby surface and that paint deflects onto the player; this usually does not count as a hit but it can be difficult to tell the difference between significant splatter and a genuine direct hit.
* '''Overshooting''' – Fields may discourage players from ''overshooting'' (also regarded as ''bonus balling'', &quot;ramping&quot;, &quot;overkill&quot;, or ''lighting up''), which is to repeatedly shoot an opposing player after he is eliminated from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailyuw.com/2001/4/18/ready-aim-paint/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711000718/http://dailyuw.com/2001/4/18/ready-aim-paint/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 11, 2012|title=Ready, Aim, Paint!|author=Santschi, Mark|date=April 18, 2001|accessdate=September 21, 2009|newspaper=The Daily of the University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered overshooting if a player knew the opponent was eliminated but continued to shoot, disregarding the safety of the opposing player and risking dangerous injury to others.
* '''Ramping''' – Ramping is a feature of many electronic markers, where after a certain number of rapid shots or upon a threshold rate-of-fire being achieved by the player, the gun will begin firing faster than the trigger is being pulled. Ramping of rate of fire is prohibited or sharply limited at most paintball fields, however it is allowed in various tournament formats with specific rules governing when and how the marker may ramp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warpig.com/paintball/newbie/dictionary/index3.shtml|title=Warpig.com Paintball Dictionary|date=January 2006|publisher=Warpig.com via Corinthian Media Services|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wiping''' – Players may attempt to cheat by ''wiping'' paint from themselves, to pretend they were not hit and stay in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;voicepaly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=3647|title=Ready, Aim ... Paint?|accessdate=September 16, 2009|date=January 3, 2005|author=Kousnetz, Zack|publisher=The Paly Voice}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; If caught, &quot;wipers&quot; are generally called out of the game, and in recreational paintball may be ejected from the field for multiple instances of wiping. Various tournament rules state additional penalties for players or teams caught wiping, such as &quot;3-for-1&quot; (calling the wiping player and the nearest two players out) in PSP capture-the-flag, or a prescribed number of &quot;penalty minutes&quot; in XBall.
* '''Non-contact''' - While paintball does involve tagging players with paintball projectiles, this is generally considered the sole point of physical contact between members of opposing teams. Players are generally prohibited from physically contacting other players, such as colliding with them, physically restraining them, and especially using fists, feet, protective gear or the markers themselves to hit other players. Fisticuffs in particular are dangerous not only to the participants but to all players on or off the field, and referees are generally trained to respond immediately and aggressively to stop the fight, and to eject and ban instigators of these fights.

=== Strategy ===
Player and team strategy varies depending on the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents to reduce the number of directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.

A key element of intermediate and advanced strategy is the concept of &quot;firing lanes&quot;. These are clear lines of sight between obstacles on the field and thus potentially between opposing players on the field behind them. A lane is &quot;occupied&quot; if at least one player of the opposing team can fire along it, and it's &quot;active&quot; if any player is firing along it, friend or foe. Occupied and active lanes hinder player movement as the player risks getting hit and eliminated. Open fields with sparse cover often have long open lanes between most or all bunkers on the field, most of which will be occupied if not active. Therefore, players have to keep track of which lanes to and from their bunker become occupied by the other team, so the player can make sure the bunker is between themselves and the opponent(s). This becomes harder the more occupied firing lanes there are; when most available firing lanes on the field are occupied, each team has to create cover in at least one direction using suppressing fire (rounds sent to the opponent's location designed to keep their head down more than to eliminate them). Speedball, which tends to use small open fields with relatively few obstacles, requires each player to use hundreds of paintballs in the course of a game to keep his opponents pinned down, lest he be pinned himself. Conversely, if most firing lanes on the field are clear, players on each team have greater mobility and the use of covering fire to pin an opponent is less useful as the player can stay behind cover while moving long distances, so players tend to fire less and move more to gain clear shots. Urban scenarios and woodsball fields tend to be larger and with more cover, shortening firing lanes and requiring players to move more to get good shots against their opponent.

Typically, strategy is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork will be seen at the beginning of the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and strategy is seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be trying to do in various situations during the game.

== Playing venues ==
[[File:Inflatable paintball bunkers.jpg|thumb|right|A &quot;speedball&quot; field consisting of inflatable paintball bunkers.]]
[[File:Paintball Venue in Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|A non-commercial, community paintball field with wooden structures in Mexico, which is used in playing &quot;renegade&quot; or &quot;gotcha&quot; paintball.]]
Paintball is played at both commercial venues, which require paid admission, and private land; both of which may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.paintballing.co.uk|title = Paintballing LTD|accessdate = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or [[urban area]], and may involve a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9008463|title=Video Report – Blountville-based paintball team ranked fifth in nation, heading to World Championships|accessdate=October 31, 2014|date=October 7, 2008|publisher=Kingsport Publishing Corporation|work=www.timesnews.net|last = Smith|first = Rain|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013133046/http://timesnews.net/article.php?id=9008463|archivedate = October 13, 2008|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable [[bunkers]]; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers are little more than air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as &quot;can&quot; and &quot;snake&quot; bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.

Commercial venues may provide amenities such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields are &quot;BYOP&quot; (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online and use it at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMRPB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emrpaintball.com/fpo.shtml|title=Field Paint Only Policy – see number 24|accessdate=February 16, 2010|publisher=EMR Paintball|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324143022/http://www.emrpaintball.com/fpo.shtml|archivedate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GATSPLAT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatsplat.com/fpo.asp|title=FPO?

So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell only approved paint and require that field paint be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatsplat.com/fpo.asp |title=Field Paint Only policy and explanation at GatSplat in Lewisville, TX, an indoor paintball facility |publisher=Gatsplat.com |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718174251/http://www.gatsplat.com/fpo.asp |archivedate=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing on a non-established field is sometimes referred to as ''renegade'' or ''gonzo'' play or ''outlaw ball'' (with the players nicknamed ''renegade ballers'' or ''outlaws'').&lt;ref name=&quot;News Tribune, The&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/|title=SPLAT! ; South Sound Plays Host to Some of the Best in the World of Paintball|accessdate=September 15, 2009|publisher=News Tribune, The|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715171911/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/|archivedate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though less expensive and less structured than play at a commercial facility, the lack of safety protocols, instruction, and [[Regulation|oversight]] can lead to higher incidence of injuries.

=== Leagues ===
{{Main|List of paintball leagues}}
A Speedball [[Sports league|league]] is an organization that provides a regulated competition for Speedball players to compete. Leagues can be of various sizes (for example, regional, national or international) and offer organized tournaments and or games for professional, [[semi-professional]], and [[amateur]] teams, sometimes with financial prizes. The first British national league was the British Paintball League created in 1989 by Gary Morhall, Richard Hart and Derek Wildermuth in Essex England.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Paintball League&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://makrobicz.com/bpl.php |title=British Paintball League |publisher=Makrobicz.com |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324011233/http://makrobicz.com/bpl.php |archive-date=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BPL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrymartin.me.uk/paintball.html |title=Terry Reflects on early paintball days |publisher=Terrymartin.me.uk |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Midland Masters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p8ntballer-forums.com/vb/showthread.php?8606-MIDLANDS-MASTERS-2002-Series-Standings|title=British Paintball League to reach Midlands |publisher=P8ntballer-forums.com|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inthepaint&quot; /&gt; As of 2017, the major leagues in the United States are the National X-ball League (NXL), Carolina Field Owners Association (CFOA), Maximum Velocity Paintball Series (MVPS), the Northern Xtreme Paintball League (NXPL).&lt;ref name=&quot;inthepaint&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://68caliber.com/?p=5661|title=NPPL Info Dump|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213023221/http://68caliber.com/?p=5661|archivedate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) in Asia, the Millennium Series in western Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/dietandfitness/3354589/Paintball-gunning-for-the-games.html|work=Telegraph.co.uk|title=Paintball: gunning for the games|author=Davidson, Max|date=May 3, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Centurio series in [[Eastern Europe]], and the National Collegiate Paintball Association in the US and Canada (A league was also created for high school and college players, the NCPA.*Not recognized by the NCAA*).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.propaintball.com/|title=Pro Paintball – News, Teams, Industry, Leagues, Gear, and more|accessdate=March 18, 2010}} See list of current leagues under North American Leagues menu&lt;/ref&gt; They are supplemented by various regional and local leagues spread worldwide. Within these leagues it is narrowed down further to divisions. There are six divisions from division 5 to division 1 besides various professional leagues.

=== Tournament format ===
The nature and timing of paintball events are specified by the league running the tournament, with the league also defining match rules – such as number of players per team (anywhere from 3-7 players per team), or acceptable equipment for use. The number of matches in a tournament is largely defined by the number of available teams playing. However, the NSL offers non-tournament game play where a more traditional game day format has been adopted. Two teams face off at a set time and play only one game per game day in the season as beginners play a 24-minute game and amateur and professionals play a 32-minute game, both requiring 90 minutes to resolve.

A match in a tournament is refereed by a judge, whose authority and decisions are final. Tournament rules can vary as specified by the league, but may include for example – not allowing players to use devices to communicate with other persons during a game, or not allowing players to unduly alter the layout of terrain on the field. In contrast to a casual game designed for fun, a tournament is much stricter and violations of rules may result in penalties for the players or entire teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSP2009RulesGeneral&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pspevents.com/uploads/PSP2009RulesGeneral.pdf |title=PSP Point Rules |date=February 12, 2009 |publisher=PSP Events |accessdate=February 18, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though tournament paintball was originally played in the woods, [[speedball (paintball)|speedball]] became the standard competitive format in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;inthepaint&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 23, 2009|title=In The Paint|url=http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=13664|author=Alvania, Rebecca|date=May 23, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814162308/http://www2.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=13664|archivedate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://68caliber.com/?p=5940|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709124030/http://68caliber.com/?p=5940|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|title=National Pump League Goes Back To Paintball's Roots|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 17, 2010|publisher=.68caliber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller fields made use of artificial terrain such as bunkers, allowing symmetrical fields that eliminate terrain advantages for either team; woodsball fields having no such guarantee.&lt;ref name=&quot;stpetersburgtimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pdQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WngDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6610,2199580&amp;dq=paintball+tournament+symmetrical&amp;hl=en|title=Styles of play|accessdate=February 17, 2010|date=May 18, 2006|publisher=St Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, fields using inflatable bunkers, tethered to the ground with stakes, have become standard for most tournament formats; the soft, yielding bunkers reduce the occurrence of injuries, the bunkers deflate to store in a compact space and anchor to the ground with tent stakes, allowing for temporary fields to be set up and torn down with less impact on the ground underneath, and the arrangement of bunkers can be easily re-configured to maintain novelty of play or to simulate a predetermined field layout for an upcoming event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paintball-tips-and-tricks.com/airball.html |title=Information on Airball |publisher=Paintball-tips-and-tricks.com |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional teams ===
{{Main|List of professional paintball teams}}
A professional paintball team is one that plays paintball with the financial, equipment or other kind of support of one or more sponsors, often in return for advertising rights. Professional teams can have different names in different leagues due to franchising and [[sponsorship]] issues.

== Accused terrorists' usage ==
In the past, unlawful groups and terrorists have been accused of using paintball for tactical training purposes in connection with the following incidents:

== Safety statistics ==
[[File:Paintball 1.jpg|thumb|left|Paintball players in mid-game]]
The rate of injury to paintball participants has been estimated as 45 injuries per 100,000 participants per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15178668&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Injuries from paintball game related activities in the United States, 1997–2001 | journal = [[Injury Prevention]] | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 139–43 |date=June 2004 | pmid = 15178668 | pmc = 1730099 | url = http://ip.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15178668 | author1 = Conn JM | author2 = Annest JL | author3 = Gilchrist J | author4 = Ryan GW |name-list-format=vanc | doi = 10.1136/ip.2003.004101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research published by the Minnesota Paintball Association has argued that paintball is one of the statistically safest sports to participate in, with 20 injuries per 100,000 players annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;(2003): National Injury Information Clearinghouse of the U.

A 2003 study of the 24 patients with modern sports eye injuries presenting to the eye emergency department of Porto São João Hospital between April 1992 and March 2002 included five paintball eye injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Modern sports eye injuries | journal = [[The British Journal of Ophthalmology]] | volume = 87 | issue = 11 | pages = 1336–9 |date=November 2003 | pmid = 14609827 | pmc = 1771879 | doi = 10.1136/bjo.87.11.1336| url = http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14609827 | author1 = Capão Filipe JA|author2 = Rocha-Sousa A | author3 = Falcão-Reis F | author4 = Castro-Correia J |name-list-format=vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a one-year study undertaken by the Eye Emergency Department, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in [[Boston]] has shown that most sports eye injuries are caused by [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[hockey]], and [[racquetball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larrison WI, Hersh PS, Kunzweiler T, Shingleton BJ |title=Sports-related ocular trauma |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=97 |issue=10 |pages=1265–9 |date=October 1990 |pmid=2243676 |doi=10.1016/s0161-6420(90)32421-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis concluded that eye injuries incurred from paintball were in settings where protective equipment such as masks were not enforced, or were removed by the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Changing trends in paintball sport-related ocular injuries | journal = [[Archives of Ophthalmology]] | volume = 118 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–4 |date=January 2000 | pmid = 10636415 | author1 = Fineman MS | author2 = Fischer DH | author3 = Jeffers JB | author4 = Buerger DG | author5 = Repke C |name-list-format=vanc | doi = 10.1001/archopht.118.1.60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, paintball has received criticism due to incidents of injury. In Canada in 2007, an eleven-year-old boy lifted his mask and was shot point blank in the eye by an adult playing on the same field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20070628/paintball_injuries_070628/20070628/?hub=Health&amp;subhub=PrintStory|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724182909/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20070628/paintball_injuries_070628/20070628/?hub=Health&amp;subhub=PrintStory|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 24, 2012|title=Doctors say paintball too dangerous for kids|accessdate=September 16, 2009|date=June 28, 2007|author=DeMelt, Annie|publisher=CTV.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to calls by the [[Montreal Children's Hospital]] to restrict the minimum age of paintball participants to 16 years.

Additionally, the use of paintball markers outside a regulated environment has caused concern.

== Legality ==
=== Argentina ===
Paintball has been considered an inappropriate game, that promotes [[violence]], by the Parliament of the Province of Buenos Aires. The approved law 14,492 (December 2012) regulates its use: it is totally forbidden for children under 16 years old, but can be played with written authorization by the parents, or responsible person in charge, of youths between 16 and 18 years old. Originally, the initiative had proposed the total prohibition for players under 21 years old. The penalties are also established by law, as 30 days of communitarian work or other modalities.

=== Australia ===
Paintballing in Australia is controlled by the police in each state, with differing minimum age requirements. Players under 18 are required to have a guardian sign a consent form. The minimum ages are 12 for [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], 15 for [[Queensland]], 16 for [[New South Wales]], [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Previously the minimum age for Victoria was 18, but legislation has recently been introduced to lower the legal age for paintball to 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://crumpets.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/bill/jlaaomb2014550/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both major parties in Victoria have supported the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snipersden.com.au/paintball-age-limit-change-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230158/http://www.snipersden.com.au/paintball-age-limit-change-2/ |archivedate=2016-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintball has been recently legalized in [[Tasmania]] as of 4 November 2016  .&lt;ref name=&quot;tasmanianews&quot; /&gt;

To own a paintball marker privately in Australia (outside Tasmania and the Northern Territory) one must hold a valid firearms license endorsed for paintball use.

In the Northern Territory they are considered a Class C firearm and private ownership is illegal.

In Western Australia they are considered a Category E(5) miscellaneous weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Ourservices/PoliceLicensingServices/Firearms2/Firearmslicencesandcategories/tabid/1903/Default.aspx|title=Western Australia Firearms Classes|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operators must adhere to legislation on gun storage, safety training and field sizes; private owners have to secure their markers according to state law on storage, as by law paintball markers are considered firearms in Australia.

=== Cyprus ===
As in Australia, paintballing in the Republic of Cyprus is controlled by police, i.e. all paintball markers must be registered and licensed, the field must be in certain standards that is inspected by police in order to obtain the license for a paintball field. The process of buying one's own paintball marker is just as complicated, the buyer must have completed military service, have a clean police record and be over the age of 18 years.

Minimum age for paintball is 14 years old with parents consent, from 16 and up no parental consent is required. It is required that all players must wear protective mask as well and neck and chest protection.
Paintball markers are not allowed to exceed 290 fps velocity and a maximum of 12 bit/s firing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dna-paintball.com/paintball |title=Paintball at DNA - Paintball - DNA Paintball Cyprus |publisher=Dna-paintball.com |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125123811/http://www.dna-paintball.com/paintball/ |archive-date=2013-01-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All paintball markers sold officially in Germany must be certified by the government &quot;Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt&quot; (PTB) (Federal Physical and Technical Institute) to operate within these limits and must have a registered serial number and an official stamp on the firing mechanism. In May 2009, reacting to the [[Winnenden school shooting]], German lawmakers announced plans to ban games such as paintball as they allegedly trivialized and encouraged violence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8041320.stm |title=World &amp;#124; Europe &amp;#124; Germany moves to outlaw paintball |work=BBC News |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Last Updated: 5:15PM BST May 7, 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5291891/Germany-to-ban-paintball-in-wake-of-high-school-shooting.html |title=Germany to ban paintball in wake of high school shooting |newspaper=Telegraph |date=May 7, 2009 |accessdate=May 27, 2009 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511071321/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5291891/Germany-to-ban-paintball-in-wake-of-high-school-shooting.html |archivedate=May 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plans were retracted a few days later.

=== Ireland ===
Paintballing is widely accepted as a recreational pastime in Ireland and is not directly subject to any governing regulations. In Northern Ireland all paintball guns are classified as firearms and as such all gun owners needs to obtain a license from the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland). There is also a minimum age where all players need to be 16 or older. Paintball is governed by the local Gardaí in the Republic of Ireland. A firearms licence is required for both personal and site use. Weapon storage guidelines and security must also be strictly adhered to.
