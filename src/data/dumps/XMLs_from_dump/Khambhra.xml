==History==
It is one of the 18 villages founded by [[Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas]] or [[Mistris]], as they are known in [[Kutch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chawra.com/kgk/history2.htm Kutch Gujar Kshatriyas, History &amp; names of their 18 Villages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Sinougra-houses-no-longer-live-up-to-their-claim-to-fame/274190/ Press Report after earthquake Giving details of Villages, Art &amp; Skills of Mistris of Kutch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930182039/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Sinougra-houses-no-longer-live-up-to-their-claim-to-fame/274190/ |date=2012-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20010312/ina12017.html Press Report on Houses, History of Mistiris of Kutch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220074425/http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20010312/ina12017.html |date=2012-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/6135227/Kachchh Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143114/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/6135227/Kachchh |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Gurjar-Kshatriyas-36231.htm Gurjar Kshatriyas, also known as Mistris, came to Kutch from Rajasthan. They are skilled in building construction. They first established themselves at Dhaneti and were granted 18 villages by the rulers of Kutch. They are famous designers and developers of buildings and bridges]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the early infrastructure and temples of Khambhra was also constructed by these [[Mistris]] or [[Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas]] community in late 1890s.
Almost all the old majestic houses of Khambhra with unique architect were destroyed in the earthquake on 26 January 2001. The village was rehabilitated with help of Government &amp; NGO help. But the old glory is lost.
