{{Zen Buddhism}}
'''''Zazen''''' (literally &quot;[[:wikt:坐|seated]] [[:wikt:禅|meditation]]&quot;; {{lang-ja|座禅}}; {{zh|s=坐禅|t=坐禪|p=zuò chán|w=tso&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-ch'an&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|z|uo|4|-|ch|an|2}}) is a meditative discipline that is typically the primary practice of the [[Zen|Zen Buddhist tradition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hcz1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, &amp; the Truth about Reality]]|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|page=86|year=2003|isbn= 086171380X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zmm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Zazen Instructions|url=http://zmm.mro.org/teachings/meditation-instructions/|publisher=[[Zen Mountain Monastery]]|date=December 30, 2012|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise meaning and method of zazen varies from school to school, but in general it can be regarded as a means of [[vipassana|insight]] into [[Shunyata|the nature of existence]]. In the Japanese [[Rinzai school]], zazen is usually associated with the study of [[koan]]s. The [[Sōtō]] School of Japan, on the other hand, only rarely incorporates [[koan]]s into zazen, preferring an approach where the mind has no object at all, known as [[shikantaza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hcz2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, &amp; the Truth about Reality]]|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|pages=189–190|year=2003|isbn= 086171380X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==

Zazen is considered the heart of Japanese Sōtō [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;hcz1&quot;/&gt; The aim of zazen is just [[sitting]], that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.&lt;ref name=&quot;hcz2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryū|authorlink=Shunryū Suzuki|title=[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]|pages=15–16|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-159030849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

=== Sitting ===

[[File:Hsuan Hua Hong Kong 1.jpeg|thumb|A young master [[Hsuan Hua]] sitting in full [[Lotus position|lotus]]]]
In Zen temples and monasteries, practitioners traditionally sit zazen as a group in a meditation hall, usually referred to as the ''[[zendo]]''. The practitioner sits on a cushion called a ''[[zafu]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;zmm&quot;/&gt; which itself is usually placed on top of a low, flat mat called a ''[[zabuton]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;zmm&quot;/&gt;

Before taking one's seat, and after rising at the end of the period of zazen, a Zen practitioner performs a ''gassho'' bow to their seat, and a second bow to fellow practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=How To Sit Zazen|url=http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/dsla/zazen.html|publisher=Dogen Sangha Los Angeles|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of a period of zazen is traditionally announced by ringing a bell three times (''shijosho''), and the end of a round by ringing the bell either once or twice (''hozensho'').

Long periods of zazen may alternate with periods of [[kinhin]] (walking meditation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Heine (ed.)|first1=Steven|last2=Wright (ed.)|first2=Dale S.|authorlink1=Steven Heine|title=Zen Ritual : Studies of Zen Buddhist Theory in Practice: Studies of Zen Buddhist Theory in Practice|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|page=223|ISBN=9780198041467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maezumi|first1=Hakuyu Taizan|last2=Glassman|first2=Bernie|authorlink1=Taizan Maezumi|authorlink2=Bernie Glassman|title=On Zen Practice: Body, Breath, Mind|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|pages=48–49|year=2002|isbn= 086171315X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Posture ===
The posture of zazen is seated, with folded legs and hands, and an erect but settled spine.&lt;ref name=&quot;zmbm&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryū|authorlink=Shunryū Suzuki|title=[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]|page=8|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-159030849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hands are folded together into a simple [[mudra]] over the belly.&lt;ref name=&quot;zmbm&quot;/&gt;  In many practices, the practitioner breathes from the ''[[Dantian|hara]]'' (the [[center of gravity]] in the belly) and the eyelids are half-lowered, the eyes being neither fully open nor shut so that the practitioner is neither distracted by, nor turning away from, external stimuli.

The legs are folded in one of the standard sitting styles:&lt;ref name=&quot;zmm&quot;/&gt;

* ''Kekkafuza'' (full-[[Lotus position|lotus]])
* ''Hankafuza'' (half-lotus)
* ''Burmese'' (a cross-legged posture in which the ankles are placed together in front of the sitter)
* ''[[Seiza]]'' (a kneeling posture using a bench or [[zafu]])

In addition, it is not uncommon for modern practitioners to practice zazen in a chair,&lt;ref name=&quot;zmm&quot;/&gt; often with a wedge or cushion on top of it so that one is sitting on an incline, or by placing a wedge behind the lower back to help maintain the natural curve of the spine. One can sit comfortably, but not too comfortably, so as to avoid falling asleep. While each of these styles is commonly taught today, Master [[Dogen]] recommended only ''Kekkafuza'' and ''Hankafuza''.

=== Types ===
In his book ''Three Pillars of Zen'', [[Philip Kapleau]] says that practitioners in the Rinzai school face in, towards each other with their backs to the wall, and in the Sōtō school, practitioners face the wall or a curtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |ref=harv | last1 = Kapleau | first1 = Philip | authorlink=Philip Kapleau| title = The Three pillars of Zen: teaching, practice, and enlightenment | year = 1989 | publisher = Anchor Books | location = New York |page=10(8)| isbn = 0-385-26093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapleau quotes [[Hakuun Yasutani]]'s lectures for beginners. In lecture four, Yasutani describes the five kinds of zazen: ''bompu'', ''gedo'', ''shojo'', ''daijo'', and ''saijojo'' (he adds the latter is the same thing as [[shikantaza]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |ref=harv | last1 = Kapleau | first1 = Philip |authorlink=Philip Kapleau| title = The Three pillars of Zen: teaching, practice, and enlightenment | year = 1989 | publisher = Anchor Books | location = New York |pages=48–53| isbn = 0-385-26093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instruction ===
Very generally speaking, zazen practice is taught in one of three ways.

# Concentration
# [[Koan]] Introspection
# [[Shikantaza]] (just sitting)&lt;ref&gt;Deshimaru, Taisen (1981) The Way of True Zen, American Zen Association, {{ISBN|978-0972804943}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Koan  practice is usually associated with the [[Rinzai]] school and Shikantaza with the [[Sōtō]] school.  In reality many Zen communities use both methods depending on the teacher and students.

====Concentration====

The initial stages of training in zazen resemble traditional Buddhist [[samatha]] meditation in actual practice, and emphasize the development of the [[Five Strengths|power]] of concentration, or ''joriki''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bielefeldt1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Carl Bielefeldt]]|title=Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw0IdBImyRYC&amp;pg=PA137|date=16 August 1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-90978-6|pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (定力) ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|samādhibala}}''). The student begins by focusing on the breath at the ''[[Dantian|hara/tanden]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;DogenLeighton2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Dogen|Eihei Dogen]]|author2=[[Taigen Dan Leighton]]|author3=[[Shōhaku Okumura]]|author4=[[John Daido Loori]]|title=Dogen's Extensive Record: A Translation of the Eihei Koroku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nqqLwjgzQoC&amp;pg=PA349|date=16 March 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-86171-670-8|pages=348–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Anapanasati|mindfulness of breath]] (''ānāpānasmṛti'') exercises such as counting breath (''sūsokukan'' 数息観) or just watching it (''zuisokukan'' 随息観). [[mantra|Mantras]] are also sometimes used in place of counting. Practice is typically to be continued in one of these ways until there is adequate &quot;[[Ekaggata|one-pointedness]]&quot; of mind to constitute an initial experience of ''[[samadhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]''. At this point, the practitioner moves to one of the other two methods of zazen.

====Koan introspection====
{{main|Koan}}

Having developed awareness, the practitioner can now focus his or her consciousness on a koan as an object of meditation.  Since koans are, ostensibly, not solvable by intellectual reasoning, koan introspection is designed to shortcut the intellectual process leading to direct realization of a reality beyond thought.

====Shikantaza====
{{main|Shikantaza}}

Shikantaza is a form of meditation, in which the practitioner does not use any specific object of meditation;&lt;ref name=&quot;hcz2&quot;/&gt; rather, practitioners remain as much as possible in the present moment,  aware of and observing what passes through their minds and around them. [[Dogen]] says, in his ''[[Shobogenzo]]'', &quot;Sitting fixedly, think of not thinking. How do you think of not thinking? Nonthinking. This is the art of zazen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Zazen|author=[[Dogen]]|url=http://stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|publisher=Soto Zen Text Project|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
