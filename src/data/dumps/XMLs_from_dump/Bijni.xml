The Bijni branch of the [[Koch dynasty]] controlled its feudatory from the present-day Bijni town from 1671 till 1864 when it was attacked by Jhawlia Mech, a chieftain from Bhutan which used to be part of Kamrup Kingdom. This resulted in the capital moving to [[Dumuria]]. In 1897, an earthquake destroyed many royal palaces and other structures and the capital moved again. The control of Bijni by the Koch Dynasty ended in 1956, as the [[Indian Government]] took direct control of the entire region.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
