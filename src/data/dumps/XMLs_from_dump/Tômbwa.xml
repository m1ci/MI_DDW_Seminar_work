It is located on the shore of [[Port Alexander, Angola|Port Alexander]], an important harbor on the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] for oil production and fishing. The port had refrigeration facilities installed with [[European Union]] assistance at the Tombwe canning factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedti.gov.za/econdb/raportt/angolaOverview.html Economic Report on Angola by the South African government]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during Portuguese Angola the largest fishing port of Angola and one of the largest in West Africa.  It was established by fishermen from [[Olhão]], [[Algarve]] around 1863 in a sheltered bay, and joined by the fishermen of [[Póvoa de Varzim]] in 1921, who left Brazil not wishing to lose Portuguese nationality by becoming Brazilian nationals. Due to the fishing industry, Porto Alexandre gained city status in 1961.

==Decline of the fishing industry==
As of 2019 fishing harvests are declining. This is believed to have resulted from ocean warming, harvesting by industrial-sized foreign ships, and oxygen depletion. The movement of Angolans to the area based on its reputation for plentiful fishing has also contributed to the shortage of fish near the shore. As a result, anglers, usually from South Africa, who used to travel there for the fine fishing, no longer come.The prime fishing area, characterized by upwelling nutrient-rich cold water, has moved south along the Namibian coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp112719&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author1=Max Bearak |author2=Chris Mooney |author3=Carolyn Van Houten |author4=John Muyskens |title=2°C: BEYOND THE LIMIT: A crisis in the water is decimating this once-booming fishing town |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/world/climate-environment/angola-climate-change/ |accessdate=November 30, 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=November 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
