'''Tenball''' was a cue sports tournament that with some modifications was played on [[Snooker table|the same table]] and with [[Snooker ball|the same ball]]s as [[snooker]], its rules and gameplay being a mix of those of snooker and of [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]]. An [[ITV Network|ITV]]/[[London Weekend Television|LWT]] TV series '''''Tenball''''' was created that formed a tournament, featuring the game hosted by [[Phillip Schofield]]. The show ran for one series, throughout 1995, in an eight-man tournament, won by [[Jimmy White]].

==Rules==
The game and the [[ITV Network|ITV]]/[[London Weekend Television|LWT]] TV series '''''Tenball''''' focused on a tournament of it were created in 1995 by a team consisting of managers Russ Lindsay and [[Peter Powell (disc jockey)|Peter Powell]], entrepreneur [[Barry Hearn]], and snooker and pool player [[Steve Davis]]. The series was hosted by [[Phillip Schofield]] and its set was designed by [[Andy Walmsley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adam_TENB&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = TENBALL – ADAM'S NOSTALGIC MEMORIES | work = ADAM'S NOSTALGIC MEMORIES | accessdate = 2018-05-21 | url = https://adamnostalgia.wordpress.com/tag/tenball/ | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180523090716/https://adamnostalgia.wordpress.com/tag/tenball/ | archivedate = 2018-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sole season, in 1995, saw [[Jimmy White]] win the tournament, while [[Peter Ebdon]] achieved the [[Highest snooker break|highest break]] of 122 &lt;ref name=&quot;ukgameshow&quot;/&gt; (out of a possible 200).&lt;ref name=&quot;rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ukgameshow&quot;/&gt;

The hybrid snooker/pool game the show revolves around is not regularly played outside the show, and features a {{Cuegloss|pack}} ({{cuegloss|rack}}) of 16 {{Cuegloss|object balls}} in a diamond configuration, 15 {{cuegloss|red ball|reds}} worth 1 each and a black-and-yellow 10 ball, as well as various {{cuegloss|colour ball|colour balls}} with differing point values, on specific {{cuegloss|spot|spots}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;info&quot;/&gt; The pack is not racked at the {{cuegloss|top|top of the table}} behind the {{cuegloss|pink spot}} as it would be in snooker, but, unlike in any other form of [[pocket billiards]], racked in the middle of the table on the {{cuegloss|center spot|centre spot}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukgameshow&quot;/&gt;

Games competed over for ITV's ''Tenball'' series featured best of five matches. However, unlike in regular snooker, the first potted colour in a break associated the score for every colour potted in that break thereafter, rather than the score of the colour that the ball that was potted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukgameshow&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tenball - UKGameshows | work = ukgameshows.com | accessdate = 21 May 2018 | url = http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tenball | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170702044844/http://ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tenball | archivedate = 2 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tenball - mix between pool and snooker | work = euronet.nl | date = 25 July 2013 | accessdate = 21 May 2018 | url = http://www.euronet.nl/users/cor/tenball.html | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170408095500/http://www.euronet.nl/users/cor/tenball.html | archivedate = 8 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also promoted {{cuegloss|ball in hand}} similar to pool if a foul was played, or could receive ten points for each foul shot. Three consecutive fouls from a player would cause them to retire from the frame.&lt;ref name=&quot;rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Info2/&gt;

==Prize Money==
A potential £30,000 was on offer in the tournament (plus potential losers/appearance money that was not divulged), with £10,000 for a {{cuegloss|maximum break}} of 200, and £20,000 for the winner ([[Jimmy White]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;thec_WhoR&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Who Remembers Tenball? | work = thecueview.com | accessdate = 2018-05-21 | url = http://www.thecueview.com/who-remembers-tenball-.html | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180523090716/http://www.thecueview.com/who-remembers-tenball-.html | archivedate = 2018-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
