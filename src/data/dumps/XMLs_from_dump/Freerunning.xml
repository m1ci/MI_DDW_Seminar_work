'''Freerunning''' is a way of expression by interacting with various obstacles and environment. Freerunning may include flipping and spinning. These movements are usually adopted from other sports, such as [[gymnastics]], [[Tricking (martial arts)|tricking]] or [[breakdancing]]. Freerunners can create their own moves, flows and lines in different landscapes. It is all about becoming creative in an objective environment. Practitioners of freerunning usually do [[parkour]] as well. Freerunning is often associated with parkour by adding acrobatic and stylish moves, showcasing the art of movement. Freerunning was founded by [[Sebastien Foucan]], who discussed the subject in [[Jump London]] in 2003.

Foucan developed freerunning as a more inclusive form of ''parkour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Parkour? |work=World Freerunning Parkour Federation |url= http://www.wfpf.com/parkour/ |date=2018 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkour's efficient military style [[obstacle course]] training lends itself to [[martial art]] as a means of weapons avoidance and efficiently closing a distance to an opponent. Freerunning is derived from parkour, but it emphasizes not efficiency but artistry, allowing room for fancy flips and stylistic acrobatics.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;freerunning&quot; was first used in the documentary, ''[[Jump London]]''. The name came about because of a suggestion by Guillaume Pelletier [https://parkour.uk/what-we-do/what-is-parkour/ (Origin of the FreeRunning)], who was working with the group of practitioners at this time. In the documentary, freerunning was defined as an English translation of parkour.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Foucan has since said that the confusion regarding the roots of the term came out of the fact that he was still formulating his ideas at the time of the filming.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
The central principle of freerunning is that one should express oneself by moving fluidly in one's environment; there are no limitations on the form of this movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freerun&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Foucan |first= Sebastien |authorlink= Sebastien Foucan |title= Freerunning |year= 2008 |publisher=Michael O'Mara Books |location= U.K. |isbn= 978-1-56975-652-2 |page=8|id= {{ASIN|1843173301|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucan expands on a number of basic principles of the sport in his book, ''Freerunning''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freerun&quot;/&gt; Other practitioners have suggested other principles. For example, [[Daniel Ilabaca]] encourages people to think positively, suggesting that practitioners of freerunning will sometimes fall—largely because they think they might.&lt;ref name=Ilabaca1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/ |title=Parkour Legends: Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff and Oleg Vorslov |author=Declan Saldana |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807001610/http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/ |archivedate=7 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins in parkour===
{{Main|Parkour#History}}
In Western Europe, the idea of moving past obstacles for personal development or sport originated with [[Georges Hébert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://parkourgenerations.com/article/parkour-history |title=Parkour History |last=Edwardes |first=Dan |work=ParkourGenerations.com |date=22 August 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed untrained native tribes in Africa with fantastic athletic ability and created the 'natural method' system to train people using the same ideas. His ideas eventually led to the ''parcours du combattant'' ('obstacle course', literally 'assault course'), which is now a standard of military training.&lt;ref name=Hebert1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm |title=George Hébert and the Natural Method of Physical Culture |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050323090031/http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm |archivedate=23 March 2005 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikiversity|Parkour and Freerunning}}

These ideas were picked up by a young [[Raymond Belle]], who used them to practical effect while separated from his family during the [[First Indochina War]]. When he moved to France and started a family, he passed on these ideas to his son, [[David Belle|David]]. 30 years later, other young people were attracted to these ideas and a small group formed, the [[Yamakasi]], which included Foucan.&lt;ref name=&quot;gen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parkour-DB2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Parkour |last=Belle |first=David |authorlink=David Belle |year=2009 |publisher=Intervista |isbn=978-2-35756-025-3 |pages=31–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group trained together for several years and in 1997, through David Belle's brother, Jean-Francois, they started to attract attention and be invited to perform at events. The Yamakasi eventually split apart, though, because some members sought to find more individual expressions of the discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;CineParkour1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parkour-DB3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Parkour |last=Belle |first=David |authorlink=David Belle |year=2009 |publisher=Intervista |isbn=978-2-35756-025-3 |pages=71–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, action star [[Jackie Chan]] had also been heavily featuring the same concepts in most of his films ever since the early 1980s from the other side of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkourfreerunningonline.com/jackie-chans-special-style-of-parkour/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081600/http://www.parkourfreerunningonline.com/jackie-chans-special-style-of-parkour/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |title=Jackie Chan's Special Style Of Parkour |date=November 5, 2015 |publisher=Parkour and Freerunning Online: Your source of Parkour and Freerunning videos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development===
Foucan wanted to create a discipline that was more personal to the individual than parkour and more easily adapted to suit each person's individual goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freerun&quot;/&gt; His idea was similar to that of [[Bruce Lee]]'s creation of [[Jeet Kune Do]]. Foucan wanted to take everything that he had found useful and that he liked from his parkour experiences and combine it into one sport.&lt;ref name=SebLR1&gt;{{cite interview | last = Knol|first = Enzo |title = Enzo Knol – Find your way – London Real |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGq1j_xyzHM |work = London Real |location = London |date = 28 October 2012 |accessdate = 3 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucan's early ideas were first spread through the ''Jump London'' documentary (2003) and its sequel, ''[[Jump Britain]]'' (2005). Foucan has appeared in other productions, such as ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and Madonna's ''[[Confessions Tour]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CineParkour1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ciné Parkour |last=Angel |first=Julie |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-9569717-1-5 |pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each appearance both the discipline and Foucan himself increased in fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freerun&quot; /&gt;

==International==
In 2014, the [[BBC]] traveled to J&amp;K
[[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30347099/ |title=Kashmir Freerunning Finding Freedom in the Art of Parkour|work=BBC|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to highlight the youth partaking in freerunning as a form of freedom of expression.
