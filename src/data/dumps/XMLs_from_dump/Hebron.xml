[[Judaism]] ranks Hebron the second-holiest city after [[Jerusalem]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Scharfstein 124&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Scharfstein|1994|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while some Muslims regard it as one of the four holy cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dumper|2003|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salaville|1910|p=185}}:'For these reasons after the Arab conquest of 637 Hebron &quot;was chosen as one of the four holy cities of Islam.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aksan|Goffman|2007|p=97}}: 'Suleyman considered himself the ruler of the four holy cities of Islam, and, along with Mecca and Medina, included Hebron and Jerusalem in his rather lengthy list of official titles.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honigmann|1993|p=886}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|Hebron Protocol]] of 1997 divided the city into two sectors: H1, controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and H2, roughly 20% of the city, administered by Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary.org&quot;&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/tiph5.html An Introduction to the City of Hebron&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories|military administration of the West Bank (COGAT)]]. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the [[Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron]].

Hebron is a busy hub of [[West Bank]] trade, generating roughly a third of the area's [[gross domestic product]], largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zacharia|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, limestone, [[Palestinian pottery|pottery]] workshops and [[Hebron glass|glassblowing]] factories, and has the major dairy-product manufacturer ''al-Juneidi''. The old city of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old [[bazaar]]s. The city is home to [[Hebron University]] and [[Palestine Polytechnic University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hasasneh|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flusfeder|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebron is attached to cities of [[ad-Dhahiriya]], [[Dura, Hebron|Dura]], [[Yatta, Hebron|Yatta]], the surrounding villages with no borders. Hebron Governorate is the largest Palestinian governorate, with a population of 600,364 {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNIC&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hebron&quot; traces back to two [[Semitic languages|Semitic roots]], which coalesce in the form ''ḥbr'', having reflexes in [[Hebrew]] and [[Amorite]] and denoting a range of meanings from &quot;colleague&quot;, &quot;unite&quot; or &quot;friend&quot;. In the proper name ''Hebron'', the original sense may have been ''alliance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cazelles|1981|p=195}} compares Amorite ''ḫibrum''. Two roots are in play, ''ḥbr/ḫbr''. The root has magical overtones, and develops pejorative connotations in late Biblical usage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic term derives from the Qur'anic epithet for Abraham, ''Khalil al-Rahman'' ({{lang|ar|إبراهيم خليل الرحمن}}) &quot;Beloved of the Merciful&quot; or &quot;Friend of God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 4:125/Surah 4 Aya (verse) 125, ''[[Qur'an]]'' ({{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html |title=source text |accessdate=2007-07-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027154527/http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=194 n.220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic ''Al-Khalil'' thus precisely translates the ancient Hebrew [[toponym]] ''Ḥebron'', understood as ''ḥaber'' (friend).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon 2007 104&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sharon|2007|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Hebron}}

===Canaanite period===
[[File:Hebron001.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Cave of the Patriarchs]]]]
Archaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early [[Bronze Age]], covering some 24–30 [[dunam]]s centered around [[Tel Rumeida]]. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negev|Gibson|2001|pp=225–5&lt;!--?range of pages--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; This older Hebron was originally a [[Canaan]]ite royal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Towner|2001|pp=144–45}}: &quot;[T]he city was a Canaanite royal center long before it became Israelite&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abraham|Abrahamic legend]] associates the city with the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]]. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of [[Šuwardata|Shuwardata]] of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] (Canaanite) contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, [[Abdi-Kheba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albright|2000|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]] associated with Hebron are nomadic. This may also reflect a [[Kenite]] element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1903|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Heber'' is the name for a Kenite clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraeling|1925|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centres under Canaanite control. They were ruled by the three sons of [[Anak]] (''b&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;nê/y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lîdê hā'ănaq'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=361}} These non-semitic names perhaps echo either a tradition of a group of elite professional troops (Philistines, Hittites), formed in Canaan whose ascendancy was overthrow by the West-semitic clan of Caleb. They would have migrated from the Negev,&lt;/ref&gt; or may reflect some Kenite and [[Kenizzite]] migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]. This suggests that behind the [[Anakim]] legend lies some early Hurrian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Blenkinsopp|authorlink=Joseph Blenkinsopp|title=Gibeon and Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxg9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA114|year=1972|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-08368-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the [[Nephilim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua]] 10:3, 5, 3–39; 12:10, 13. {{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=177}} doubts this tradition. &quot;The book of Joshua is not a reliable source for either a historical or a  territorial discussion of the Late Bronze Age, and its evidence must be disregarded&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Genesis]] mentions that it was formerly called [[Kiryat Arba|Kirjath-arba]], or &quot;city of four&quot;, possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mulder|2004|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; four hills,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alter|1996|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a confederated settlement of four families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1995|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Abraham's purchase of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] from the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]] constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in that it signified the first &quot;real estate&quot; of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lied|2008|pp=154–62, 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first [[wiktionary:covenant|covenant]], an alliance with two local [[Amorite]] clans who became his ''ba’alei brit'' or ''masters of the covenant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elazar|1998|p=128}}: ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].ch. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Jewish period===
[[File:Hebron136.JPG|thumb|175px|Excavations at [[Tel Rumeida]]]]
The Hebron of the Bible was centered on what is now known as Tel Rumeida, while its ritual centre was located at [[Mamre|Elonei Mamre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magen|2007|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either [[Joshua]], who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, &quot;destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glick|1994|p=46}}, citing {{Bibleref2|Joshua 10:36–42}} and the influence this has had on certain settlers in the West Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[tribe of Judah]] as a whole, or specifically [[Caleb]] the Judahite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottwald|1999|p=153}}: &quot;certain conquests claimed for Joshua are elsewhere attributed to single tribes or clans, for example, in the case of Hebron (in {{Bibleref2|Joshua 10:36–37}}, Hebron's capture is attributed to Joshua; in {{Bibleref2|Judges 1:10}} to Judah; in Judges 1:20 and Joshua 14:13–14; 15:13–14&quot; to Caleb.&lt;/ref&gt; The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the [[Levites]] of the clan of [[Kohathites|Kohath]], while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 21:3–12; 1 Chronicles 6:54–56}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratcher|Newman|1983|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who expels the three giants, [[Sheshai]], [[Ahiman]], and [[Talmai]], who ruled the city. Later, the biblical narrative has [[King David]] called by God to relocate to Hebron and reign from there for some seven years ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 2:1–3}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;FritzDavies19962&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etRoNida3RgC|title=The Origins of the Ancient Israelite States|author=Schafer-Lichtenberger|date=1 September 1996|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|others=Philip R. Davies|isbn=978-0-567-60296-1|editor=Volkmar Fritz|chapter=Sociological views}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is there that the elders of Israel come to him to make a covenant before Elohim and anoint him [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottwald|1999|p=173}}, citing {{Bibleref2|2 Samuel, 5:3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Hebron again that [[Absalom]] has himself declared king and then raises a revolt against his father David ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 15:7–10}}). It became one of the principal centers of the [[Kingdom of Judah|Tribe of Judah]] and was classified as one of the six traditional [[Cities of Refuge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Japhet|1993|p=148}}. See {{Bibleref2|Joshua 20, 1–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is shown by the discovery at [[Lachish]], the second most important Judean city after Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hasson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of seals with the inscription [[LMLK seal|''lmlk Hebron'']] (to the king Hebron),&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon 2007 104&quot;/&gt; Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic centre, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the [[Dead Sea]] to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the  Negev and Egypt to the south, and the [[Shfela|Shepelah]] and the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lying along [[Way of the Patriarchs|trading routes]], it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|pp=26ff., 31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic antiquity – Second Jewish period===
[[File:Samson Fenster aus Alpirsbach.jpg|thumb|[[Samson]] removes gates of Gaza (left) and brings it to mount Hebron (right). Strassburg (1160–1170),  [[Landesmuseum Württemberg|Württemberg State Museum]] in Stuttgart]]
After the destruction of the [[First Temple]], most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1999|pp=96–99}} Carter challenges this view on the grounds that it has no archeological support.&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers found traces of [[Edom]]ite presence after the 5th–4th centuries BCE, as the area became [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid province]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lemaire|2006|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the wake of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest, Hebron was throughout the [[Hellenistic period]] under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the [[Yehud medinata|Persian]], [[History of ancient Israel and Judah#Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Judea (Roman province)#Judea as Roman province(s)|Roman]] periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God [[Qaus|Qōs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the [[Babylonian exile]] ({{Bibleref2|Nehemiah 11:25}}). During the [[Maccabean revolt]], Hebron was burnt and plundered by [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]] who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Josephus|1860|p=334}} [[Josephus Flavius]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Bk. 12, ch.8, para.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duke|2010|pp=93–94}} is sceptical.'This should be considered a raid on Hebron instead of a conquest based on subsequent events in the book of I Maccabees.'&lt;/ref&gt; The city appears to have long resisted [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean dominance]], however, and indeed as late as the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] was still considered [[Idumean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duke|2010|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=17}}:'Spätestens in römischer Zeit ist die Ansiedlung im Tal beim heutigen Stadtzentrum zu finden'.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herod the Great]], king of Judea, built the wall which still surrounds the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. During the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], Hebron was captured and plundered by [[Simon Bar Giora]], a [[Peasantry (Judea)|peasantry faction]] leader, without bloodshed. The &quot;little town&quot; was later laid to waste by [[Vespasian]]'s officer [[Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Josephus|1860|p=701}} Josephus, ''[[The Jewish War]]'', Bk 4, ch. 9, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] wrote that he &quot;slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town.&quot; After the defeat of [[Simon bar Kokhba]] in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron's [[Mamre|Terebinth]] slave-market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schürer|Millar|Vermes|1973|p=553 n.178}} citing [[Jerome]], ''in Zachariam'' 11:5; ''in Hieremiam'' 6:18; ''Chronicon paschale.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hezser|2002|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Palaestina Prima]] province at the [[Diocese of the East]]. The Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the [[Sassanid]] general [[Shahrbaraz]] in 614 when [[Khosrau II]]'s armies besieged and took Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norwich|1999|p=285}}&lt;!-- check Peng ed  p. 285 (1988)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were not permitted  to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scharfstein 124&quot;/&gt; The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628|Sassanid army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salaville 1910 185&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Salaville|1910|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic era===
Hebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic invasion in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=56–57}} cites the late testimony of two monks, Eudes and Arnoul CE 1119–1120:'When they (the Muslims) came to Hebron they were amazed to see the strong and handsome structures of the walls and they could not find an opening through which to enter, then the Jews happened to come, who lived in the area under the former rule of the Greeks (that is the Byzantines), and they said to the Muslims: give us (a letter of security) that we may continue to live (in our places) under your rule (literally-amongst you) and permit us to build a synagogue in front of the entrance (to the city). If you will do this, we shall show you where you can break in. And it was so'.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiro|1999|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] established rule over Hebron in 638, they converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scharfstein 124&quot;/&gt; It became an important station on the caravan trading  route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic bishop [[Arculf]] who visited the Holy Land during the [[Umayyad Chaliphate|Umayyad rule]] described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua Frenkel, 2011, p.28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Trade greatly expanded, in particular with [[Bedouin]]s in the [[Negev]] (''al-Naqab'') and the population to the east of the [[Dead Sea]] (''Baḥr Lūṭ''). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]) founded the [[Venice|Venetian]] glass-industry in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|1965|p=155}}, citing Anton Kisa et al.,''Das Glas im Altertum'', 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam did not view the town significant before the 10th-century, it being almost absent in Muslim literature of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalemite geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]], writing in 985 described the town as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Habra (Hebron) is the village of Abraham al-Khalil (the Friend of God)...Within it is a strong fortress...being of enormous squared stones. In the middle of this stands a dome of stone, built in Islamic times, over the sepulchre of Abraham. The tomb of Isaac lies forward, in the main building of the mosque, the tomb of Jacob to the rear; facing each prophet lies his wife. The enclosure has been converted into a mosque, and built around it are rest houses for the pilgrims, so that they adjoin the main edifice on all sides. A small water conduit has been conducted to them. All the countryside around this town for about half a stage has villages in every direction, with vineyards and grounds producing grapes and apples called Jabal Nahra...being fruit of unsurpassed excellence...Much of this fruit is dried, and sent to [[Egypt]].

In Hebron is a public guest house continuously open, with a cook, a baker and servants in regular attendance. These offer a dish of lentils and olive oil to every poor person who arrives, and it is set before the rich, too, should they wish to partake. Most men express the opinion this is a continuation of the guest house of Abraham, however, it is, in fact from the [[Waqf|bequest]] of [the [[sahaba]] (companion) of the prophet [[Muhammad]]] [[Tamim-al Dari]] and others.... The [[Amir]] of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]...has assigned to this charity one thousand [[dirham]]s yearly, ...al-Shar al-Adil bestowed on it a substantial bequest. At present time I do not know in all the realm of al-Islam any house of hospitality and charity more excellent than this one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Muqaddasi|2001|pp=156–57}}.

The custom, known as the 'table of Abraham' (''simāt al-khalil''), was similar to the one established by the [[Fatimid]]s, and in Hebron's version, it found its most famous expression. The Persian traveller [[Nasir Khusraw|Nasir-i-Khusraw]] who visited Hebron in 1047 records in his [[Safarnama]] that
{{quote|... this Sanctuary has belonging to it very many villages that provide revenues for pious purposes. At one of these villages is a spring, where water flows out from under a stone, but in no great abundance; and it is conducted by a channel, cut in the ground, to a place outside the town (of Hebron), where they have constructed a covered tank for collecting the water...The Sanctuary ([[Mashad (architecture)|Mashad]]), stands on the southern border of the town....it is enclosed by four walls. The [[Mihrab]] (or niche) and the [[Maksurah]] (or enclosed space for Friday-prayers) stand in the width of the building (at the south end). In the Maksurah are many fine Mihrabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|pp=310–11}}   [[commons:File:Strange.310.jpg|p. 310]] and [[commons:File:Strange.311.jpg|p. 311]].&lt;/ref&gt; He further recorded that &quot;They grow at Hebron for the most part barley, wheat being rare, but olives are in abundance. The [visitors] are given bread and olives. There are very many mills here, worked by oxen and mules, that all day long grind the flour, and further, there are working girls who, during the whole day are baking bread. The loaves are [about three pounds] and to every persons who arrives they give daily a loaf of bread, and a dish of lentils cooked in olive-oil, also some raisins....there are some days when as many as five hundred pilgrims arrive, to each of whom this hospitality is offered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|p=315}} and [[commons:File:Strange.315.jpg|p. 315]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|2002|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cairo Geniza|Geniza]] documents from this period refer only to &quot;the graves of the patriarchs&quot; and reveal there was an organised Jewish community in Hebron who had a synagogue near the tomb, and were occupied with accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk period]], the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, who was known as the &quot;''haver'' of the graves of the patriarchs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusader rule===
{{see also|Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem}}
The [[Caliphate]] lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian [[Crusade]]r [[Godfrey de Bouillon]] took Hebron and renamed it &quot;Castellion Saint Abraham&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|p=78}}:'The Castle of St. Abraham' was the generic Crusader name for Hebron.'&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;Israel tourguide, Avraham Lewensohn, 1979. p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and given, in turn,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|2000|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965a|p=307}}Runciman also (pp. 307–08) notes that Gerard of Avesnes was a knight from [[County of Hainaut|Hainault]] held hostage at [[Arsuf]], north of [[Jaffa]], who had been wounded by Godfrey's own forces during the siege of the port, and later returned by the Muslims to Godfrey as a token of good will.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham.  As a [[Franks|Frankish]] garrison of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], its defence was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965b|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crusaders converted the [[mosque]] and the [[synagogue]] into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]], according to [[Ali ibn abi bakr al-Harawi|Ali of Herat]] (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and &quot;a number of Franks had made their entrance therein&quot;. And they discovered &quot;(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&quot;, &quot;their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more&quot;. Similar information is given in [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn at Athir]]'s Chronicle under the year 1119; &quot;In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|pp=317–18}}   [[commons:File:Strange.317.jpg|p. 317]] and [[commons:File:Strange.318.jpg|p. 318]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Damascus|Damascene]] nobleman and historian [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of [[relics]] purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery which excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kohler|1896|pp=447ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965b|p=319}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 [[Maimonides]] visited Hebron and wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraemer|2001|p=422}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A royal domain, Hebron was handed over to [[Philip of Milly]] in 1161 and joined with the [[Oultrejordain|Seigneurie of Transjordan]]. A bishop was appointed to Hebron in 1168 and the new cathedral church of St Abraham was built in the southern part of the Haram.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boas|1999|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1167, the [[Hebron (titular see)|episcopal see of Hebron]] was created along with that of [[Kerak]] and [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] (the tomb of [[John the Baptist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richard|1999|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1170, [[Benjamin of Tudela]] visited the city, which he called by its Frankish name, ''St.Abram de Bron''.   He reported:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, but the Gentiles have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|1907|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===
The Kurdish Muslim [[Saladin]] retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=207}}. Note to editors. This account, always in Moshe Gil, refers to two distinct events, the Arab conquest from Byzantium, and the Kurdish-Arab conquest from Crusaders. In both the manuscript is a monkish chronicle, and the words used, and event described is identical. We may have a secondary source confusion here.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the city was changed back to ''Al-Khalil''. A [[Kurd]]ish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharon|2003|p=297}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] retook the city soon after. [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and [[Hospitallers]], whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian [[Sultan]] [[As-Salih Ayyub]], managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1965c|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1244, the [[Mongol raids into Palestine|Kharesmians]] destroyed the town, but left the sanctuary untouched.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salaville 1910 185&quot;/&gt; In 1260, after [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Baibars]] defeated the Mongol army, the [[minaret]]s were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Micheau|2006|p=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] rule.  The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th-century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the caverns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy-O'Connor|1998|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mill at [[Artas, Bethlehem|Artas]] was built in 1307 where the profits from its income were dedicated to the Hospital in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharon|1997|pp=117–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1318–20, the [[Na'ib]] of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of [[al-Jawali Mosque|Jawli Mosque]] to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Dandis, Wala. [https://www.scribd.com/doc/71913073/History-of-Hebron History of Hebron]. 2011-11-07. Retrieved on 2012-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebron was visited by some important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them [[Nachmanides]] (1270) and [[Ishtori Haparchi|Ishtori HaParchi]] (1322) who noted the [[Old Jewish cemetery, Hebron|old Jewish cemetery]] there. Sunni imam [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350) was penalised by the religious authorities in Damascus for refusing to recognise Hebron as a Muslim pilgrimage site, a view also held by his teacher [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meri|2004|pp=362–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian traveller, Meshulam of [[Volterra]] (1481) found not more that twenty Jewish families living in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kosover|1966|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|2010|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and recounted how the Jewish women of Hebron would disguise themselves with a veil in order to pass as Muslim women and enter the Cave of the Patriarchs without being recognized as Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamdan|2000|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minute descriptions of Hebron were recorded in Stephen von Gumpenberg's Journal (1449), by [[Felix Fabri]] (1483) and by [[Mejr ed-Din]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|pp=440–42, n.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this period, also, that the [[Mamluk]] Sultan [[Qaitbay|Qa'it Bay]] revived the old custom of the Hebron &quot;table of Abraham,&quot; and exported it as a model for his own ''[[madrasa]]'' in [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|2002|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became an immense charitable establishment near the [[Haram]], distributing daily some 1,200 loaves of bread to travellers of all faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|p=458}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian rabbi [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura]] writing of Machpelah around 1490 wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I was in the Cave of Machpelah, over which the mosque has been built; and the Arabs hold the place in high honour. All the Kings of the Arabs come here to repeat their prayers, but neither a Jew nor an Arab may enter the Cave itself, where the real graves of the Patriarchs are; the Arabs remain above, and let down burning torches into it through a window, for they keep a light always burning there. . Bread and lentil, or some other kind of pulse (seeds of peas or beans), is distributed (by the Muslims) to the poor every day without distinction of faith, and this is done in honour of Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berger|2012|p=246.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Ottoman rule===
[[File:Hebron - Roberts 1839.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hebron in 1839, after a drawing by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in ''[[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]'']]

The expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan [[Selim I]] coincided with the establishment of [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] commissions by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain, which ended centuries of the Iberian ''convivencia'' (coexistence). The ensuing [[Alhambra Decree|expulsions of the Jews]] drove many [[Sephardi Jews]] into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with some notable Sephardi [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] settling in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Idel|2005|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|pp=xv–xix}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Büssow 2011 195&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|2010|p=24}}. Tahrir registers document 20 households in 1538/9, 8 in 1553/4, 11 in 1562 and 1596/7. Gil however suggests the tahrir records of the Jewish population may be understated.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1540, renowned [[kabbalist]] [[Malkiel Ashkenazi]] bought a courtyard from the small [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] community, in which he established the Sephardi [[Abraham Avinu Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the ''Hesed Le'Abraham [[yeshiva]]'' in Hebron which attracted many students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perera|1996|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717–1729,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnay|1992|pp=89–90}} gives the figures of 12,000 quadrupling to 46,000 [[Kuruş]].&lt;/ref&gt; and were &quot;almost crushed&quot; from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a large/substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community, who paid up to avert a threatened catastrophe, after a false allegation was made accusing them of having murdered the son of a local sheikh and throwing his body into a cesspit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Emissaries from the community were frequently  sent overseas to solicit funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marcus|1996|p=85}}. In 1770, they received financial assistance from North American Jews which amounted in excess of £100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Luit|2009|p=42}}. In 1803, the rabbis and elders of the Jewish community were imprisoned after failing to pay their debts. In 1807 the community did however succeed in purchasing a 5-dunam (5,000 m²) plot where Hebron's wholesale market stands today.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated state of the patriarchs' tombs was restored to a semblance of sumptuous dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|1830|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Bey, one of the few foreigners to gain access, reported in 1807 that,&lt;blockquote&gt;all the sepulchres of the patriarchs are covered with rich carpets of green silk, magnificently embroidered with gold; those of the wives are red, embroidered in like manner. The sultans of Constantinople furnish these carpets, which are renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, upon the sepulchre of Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|1830|p=198}}. The source was a manuscript, ''The Travels of Ali Bey'', vol. ii, pp. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Hebron also became known throughout the Arab world for its glass production, abetted by Bedouin trade networks which brought up minerals from the Dead Sea, and the industry is mentioned in the books of 19th century [[Western culture|Western]] travelers to Palestine. For example, [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen]] noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; based on 26 kilns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, Robert Sears wrote that Hebron's population of 400 Arab families &quot;manufactured glass lamps, which are exported to [[Egypt]]. Provisions are abundant, and there is a considerable number of shops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sears|1844|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early 19th century travellers also remarked on Hebron's flourishing agriculture. Apart from glassware, it was a major exporter of ''dibse'', grape sugar,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1808|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the famous Dabookeh grapestock characteristic of Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1868|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine|Peasant Arab revolt]] broke out in April 1834 when [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2011|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hebron, headed by its [[nāẓir|nazir]] Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising. The town was invested and when its defences fell on 4 August it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha's army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|pp=6–11, esp. p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson 88&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|p=403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 500 Muslims from Hebron were killed in the attack and some 750 were conscripted. 120 youths were abducted and put at the disposal of Egyptian army officers. Most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the hills. Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town [[1834 Hebron massacre|at least five were killed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|pp=398–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson 88&quot;/&gt; When the Government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan-head Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|pp=398–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (''serasker''), [[Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha]], waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumoured that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1878|pp=287ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-'Azza of [[Bayt Jibrin]]), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=234–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1850, the Jewish population consisted of 45–60 Sephardi families, some 40 born in the town, and a 30-year-old Ashkenazi community of 50 families, mainly Polish and Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1847|pp=355–381, 372}}:The rabbi of the Ashkenazi community, who said they numbered 60 mainly Polish and Russian emigrants, professed no knowledge of the Sephardim in Hebron (p.377).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chabad|Lubavitch Hasidic]] movement having established a community in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|1999|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ascendency of Ibrahim Pasha devastated for a time the local glass industry for, aside from the loss of life, his plan to build a Mediterranean fleet led to severe logging in Hebron's forests, and firewood for the kilns grew rarer. At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass, the rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan eliminated Hebron as a staging point, and the Suez canal (1869) dispensed with caravan trade. The consequence was a steady decline in the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|pp=198–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (''Harat al-Kadim'') near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (''Harat al-Kazaz''), inhabited by Jews; the Mameluke-era Sheikh's Quarter (''Harat ash Sheikh'') to the north-west;and further north, the Dense Quarter (''Harat al-Harbah'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1847|p=379}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1881|p=195}} mentions a different set of names, the Quarter of the Cloister Gate (''Harat Bab ez Zawiyeh'');the Quarter of the Sanctuary (''Haret el Haram''), to the south-east.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman ''[[pasha]]'' (&quot;governor&quot;) of the ''[[sanjak]]'' (&quot;district&quot;) of Jerusalem, [[Kıbrıslı Mehmed Kamil Pasha|Kamil Pasha]], attempted to subdue the rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, with representatives from the English, French and other Western consulates as witnesses. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, the brother and strong rival of Abd al Rachman, as ''[[nāẓir|nazir]]'' of the Hebron region. After this relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=236–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1878|pp=305–308}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian Jews of the [[Karlin (Hasidic Dynasty)|Karlin Hasidic court]] settled in another part of the city in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shragai 2008&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shragai|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nadav Shragai]] Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shragai 2008&quot;/&gt; Hebron suffered from a severe drought during 1869–71 and food sold for ten times the normal value.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7xrAAAAMAAJ History of the Jews of the Netherlands Antilles, Volume 2], Isaac Samuel Emmanuel, Suzanne A. Emmanuel, American Jewish Archives, 1970. p. 754: &quot;Between 1869 and 1871 Hebron was plagued with a severe drought. Food was so scarce that the little available sold for ten times the normal value. Although the rains came in 1871, there was no easing of the famine, for the farmers had no seed to sow. The [Jewish] community was obliged to borrow money from  non-Jews at exorbitant interest rates in order to buy wheat for their fold. Their leaders finally decided to send their eminent Chief Rabbi Eliau [Soliman] Mani to Egypt to obtain relief.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; From 1874 the Hebron district as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem was administered directly from [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khalidi|1998|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 19th century the production of [[Hebron glass]] declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware, however, the products of Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace and travelling Jewish traders from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=161–62}} quoting David Delpuget ''Les Juifs d´Alexandrie, de Jaffa et de Jérusalem en 1865'', Bordeaux, 1866, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|World Fair of 1873 in Vienna]], Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=161–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, Hebron was the only city in Palestine that combined agriculture, livestock herding and trade, including the manufacture of glassware and processing of hides. This was because the most fertile lands were situated within the city limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taraki Giacaman&quot;&gt;{{harvnb| Tarākī|2006|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city, nevertheless, was considered unproductive and had a reputation &quot;being an asylum for the poor and the spiritual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taraki Giacaman2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Tarākī|2006|pp=12–14}}: &quot;Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and well into the twentieth, Hebron was a peripheral, &quot;borderline&quot; community, attracting poor itinerant peasants and those with Sufi inclinations from its environs. The tradition of ''shorabat Sayyidna Ibrahim'', a soup kitchen surviving into the present day and supervised by the ''awqaf'', and that of the Sufi ''zawaya'' gave the city a reputation for being an asylum for the poor and the spiritual, cementing the poor cast of a town supporting the unproductive and the needy (Ju'beh 2003). This reputation was bound to shed a conservative, dull cast on the city, a place not known for high living, dynamism, or innovativeness.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Differing  in architectural style from Nablus, whose wealthy merchants built handsome houses, Hebron's main characteristic was its semi-urban, semi-peasant dwellings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taraki Giacaman&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Jewish ghetto in hebron, 1921.jpg|thumb|120px|Jews in Hebron, 1921]]
Hebron was 'deeply Bedouin and Islamic',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'bleakly conservative' in its religious outlook,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a strong tradition of hostility to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|1999|p=508}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renan|1864|p=93}} remarked of the town that it was 'one of the bulwarks of Semitic ideas, in their most austere form.'&lt;/ref&gt; It had a reputation for religious zeal in jealously protecting its sites from Jews and Christians, but both the Jewish and Christian communities were apparently well integrated into the town's economic life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Büssow 2011 195&quot;/&gt; As a result of its commercial decline, tax revenues diminished significantly, and the Ottoman government, avoiding meddling in complex local politics, left Hebron relatively undisturbed, to become 'one of the most autonomous regions in late Ottoman Palestine.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=199}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish community was under French protection until 1914.  The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, Orthodox and anti-Zionist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of [[Ashkenazis]]. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campos|2007|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British rule ===
[[File:British loyalty meeting in Hebron, 3 July 1940.jpg|thumb|245px|British loyalty meeting in Hebron, July 1940]]

The British occupied Hebron on 8 December 1917. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (''[[waqf]]s''), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kupferschmidt|1987|pp=110–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, its population stood at 17,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP7fYghBFQC 1936, p. 887&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Haj Amin]], supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2008|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, al-Khaṭīb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kupferschmidt|1987|p=82}}: &quot;In any event, after his appointment, Abd al-Hayy al-Khatib not only played a prominent role in the disturbances of 1929, but, in general, appeared as one of the few loyal adherents of Hajj Amin in that town.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 per cent of the political leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarākī 2006 12–14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb| Tarākī|2006|pp=12–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the [[Palestine Arab Congress|fifth Palestinian Congress]], after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-Zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2008|pp=19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an [[1927 Jericho earthquake|earthquake struck Palestine]] on July 11, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Ben Zion, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/eyeing-nepal-experts-warn-israel-is-unprepared-for-its-own-big-one/ 'Eyeing Nepal, experts warn Israel is unprepared for its own Big One,'] [[The Times of Israel]] 27 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the [[Supreme Muslim Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kupferschmidt|1987|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time following attempts by the [[Lithuania]]n government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian [[Hebron Yeshiva]] (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi [[Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Slabodka)|Nosson Tzvi Finkel]], [[Yechezkel Sarna]] and [[Moshe Mordechai Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wein|1993|pp=138–39}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bauman|1994|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krämer|2011|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Jewish population lived on the outskirts of Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segev|2001|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1929 Hebron massacre]], Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NyopAQAAMAAJ Post-holocaust and anti-semitism – Issues 40–75 – Page 35] Merkaz ha-Yerushalmi le-ʻinyene tsibur u-medinah, Temple University. Center for Jewish Community Studies – 2006: “After the 1929 riots in Mandatory Palestine, the non-Jewish French writer [[Albert Londres]] asked him why the Arabs had murdered the old, pious Jews in Hebron and Safed, with whom they had no quarrel. The mayor answered: &quot;ln a way you behave like in a war. You don't kill what you want. You kill what you find. Next time they will all be killed, young and old.&quot; Later on, Londres spoke again to the mayor and tested him ironically by saying: &quot;You cannot kill all the Jews. There are 150,000 of them.&quot; [[Raghib al-Nashashibi|Nashashibi]] answered &quot;in a soft voice, 'Oh no, it'll take two days.”&lt;/ref&gt; and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbours, who hid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segev|2001|pp=325–26}}: ''The Zionist Archives preserves lists of Jews who were saved by Arabs; one list contains 435 names.''&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/books/the-tangled-truth The Tangled Truth,  Benny Morris]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|Palestinian Arab revolt]] (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN partition vote]], the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campos|2007|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinsohn2011&quot; /&gt;

===Jordanian rule===
At the beginning of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1860649890 ''The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews''], Benny Morris – 2003. pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb Pasha]] sent 350 [[Arab Legion]]naires and an armoured car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Armistice]] was signed, the city thus fell under [[Rule of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordanian military control]]. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Idinopulos, Jerusalem, 1994, p. 300, &quot;So severe were the Jordanian restrictions against Jews gaining access to the old city that visitors wishing to cross over from west Jerusalem...had to produce a baptismal certificate.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen, Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths, 1997, &quot;Only clergy, diplomats, UN personnel, and a few privileged tourists were permitted to go from one side to the other. The Jordanians required most tourists to produce baptismal certificates—to prove they were not Jewish ... .&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1948, the [[Jericho Conference]] was convened to decide the future of the West Bank which was held by Jordan.  Hebron notables, headed by mayor [[Muhammad Ali Ja'abari|Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari]], voted in favour of becoming part of [[Jordan]] and to recognise [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|2004|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Dumper|author2=Bruce E.

Although a significant number of people relocated to Jerusalem from Hebron during the Jordanian period,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J5U3AAAAIAAJ ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''], Sir H. A. R. Gibb 1980. p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebron itself saw a considerable increase in population with 35,000 settling in the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Efrat 1984 192&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Efrat|1984|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, signs of the previous Jewish presence in Hebron were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auerbach|2009|p=79}}: &quot;Under Jordanian rule, the last vestiges of a Jewish historical presence in Hebron were obliterated. The Avraham Avinu synagogue, already in ruins, was razed; a pen for goats, sheep, and donkeys was built on the site.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli occupation===
[[File:Hebron105.JPG|thumb|175px|Constructed in 1893, this former Jewish clinic in central Hebron now forms part of an Israeli neighbourhood.]]

After the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967, Israel occupied Hebron along with the rest of the [[West Bank]], establishing a [[Israeli Military Governorate|military government]] to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a [[land for peace]] deal, [[Yigal Allon]] proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=80–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Allon Plan]], the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=138–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ben-Gurion]] also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sternhell|1999|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sternhell|1999|p=337}}:'In building this new Jewish town, one was sending a message to the international community: for the Jews, the sites connected with Jewish history are inalienable, and if later, for circumstantial reasons, the state of Israel is obliged to give one or another of them up, the step is not considered final.'&lt;/ref&gt; settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|p=151}}: 'David's kingdom was a model for the [[Apocalyptic literature|messianic kingdom]]. David began in Hebron, so settling Hebron would lead to final redemption.'&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segev|2008|p=698}}: &quot;Hebron was considered a holy city; the massacre of Jews there in 1929 was imprinted on [[national memory]] along with the great pogroms of Eastern Europe. The messianic fervor that characterized the Hebron settlers was more powerful than the awakening that led people to settle in East Jerusalem: while Jerusalem had already been annexed, the future of Hebron was still unclear.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed. Some support the project of Jewish redevelopment, others commend living in peace with Hebronite Arabs, while a third group recommend a full pullout.&lt;ref name=jpt&gt;''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''. &quot;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1145961357122&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Field News 10/2/2002 Hebron Jews' offspring divided over city's fate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816165944/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1145961357122&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-08-16 }}&quot;, 2006-05-16&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants supporting the latter views have met with Palestinian leaders in Hebron.&lt;ref name=agf&gt;''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. &quot;[http://www.angelfire.com/il/FourMothers/Yona.html Hebron descendants decry actions of current settlers They are kin of the Jews ousted in 1929]&quot;, 1997-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 one group of descendants dissociated themselves from the settlers by calling them an obstacle to peace.&lt;ref name=agf/&gt; On May 15, 2006,  a member of a group who is a direct descendant of the 1929 refugees&lt;ref name=shragai&gt;{{Cite news

Immediately after the 1967 war, mayor al-Ja'bari had unsuccessfully promoted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity in the West Bank, and by 1972, he was advocating for a confederal arrangement with Jordan instead. al-Ja'bari nevertheless consistently fostered a conciliatory policy towards Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Reynell|title=The Economist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxVXAAAAYAAJ|volume=Volume 242|year=1972|publisher=Economist Newspaper Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was ousted by Fahad Qawasimi in the 1976 mayoral election, which marked a shift in support towards pro-PLO nationalist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattar|2005|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Jewish settlement within Hebron see their program as the reclamation of an important heritage dating back to Biblical times, which was dispersed or, it is argued, stolen by Arabs after the massacre of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bouckaert|2001|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenberg|2003|pp=162–63)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of settlement is to return to the 'land of our forefathers',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellerman|1993|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hebron model of reclaiming sacred sites in Palestinian territories has pioneered a pattern for settlers in Bethlehem and Nablus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenberg|2003|p=187}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many reports, foreign and Israeli, are sharply critical of the behaviour of Hebronite settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Bovard|2004|p=265}}, citing Charles A.

Sheik Farid Khader heads the Ja’bari tribe, consisting of some 35,000 people, which is considered one of the most important tribes in Hebron. For years, members of the Ja'bari tribe were the mayors of Hebron. Khader regularly meets with settlers and Israeli government officials and is a strong opponent of both the concept of Palestinian State and the Palestinian Authority itself.

====TIPH twentieth anniversary report====
In 2017, [[Temporary International Presence in Hebron]] (TIPH) issued a confidential report covering their 20 years of observing the situation in Hebron. The report, based in part on over 40,000 incident reports over those 20 years, found that Israel routinely violates international law in Hebron and that it is in &quot;severe and regular breach&quot; of the rights to non-discrimination laid out in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] over the lack of freedom to movement for the Palestinian residents of Hebron. The report found that Israel is in regular violation of Article 49 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. The report also found the presence of any Israeli settlement in Hebron to violate international law.&lt;ref name=20yrs&gt;{{cite web | title=Confidential 20-year monitoring report: Israel regularly breaks int'l law in Hebron | website=haaretz.com | date=2018-12-17 | url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-confidential-report-claims-israel-regularly-breaks-international-law-in-hebron-1.6747523 | access-date=2018-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli settlements==
Post-1967 settlement was impelled by theological doctrines developed in the [[Mercaz HaRav Kook]] under both its founder Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], and his son Rabbi [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], according to which the Land of Israel is holy, the people, endowed with a divine spark, are holy, and that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived, requiring that the Land and People be united in occupying the land and fulfilling the commandments. Hebron has a particular role in the unfolding 'cosmic drama': traditions hold that Abraham purchased land there, that King David was its king, and the tomb of Abraham covers the entrance to the [[Garden of Eden]], and is a site excavated by Adam, who, with Eve, is buried there. Redemption will occur when the feminine and masculine characteristics of God are united at the site. Settling Hebron is not only a right and duty, but is doing the world at large a favour, with the community's acts an example of the Jews of Hebron being &quot;a light unto the nations&quot; (''[[Light Unto the Nations|Or la-Goyim]]'') &lt;ref name =&quot;Røislien&quot;&gt;Hanne Eggen Røislien,  [http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/14/14  'Living with Contradiction: Examining the Worldview of the Jewish Settlers in Hebron,'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002002611/http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/14/14 |date=2015-10-02 }} [[International Journal of Conflict and Violence|IJCV]], Vol.1 (2) 2007, pp.169–184, pp.181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; and bringing about their redemption, even if this means breaching secular laws, expressed in religiously motivated violence towards Palestinians, who are widely viewed as &quot;mendacious, vicious, self-centered, and impossible to trust&quot;. Clashes with Palestinians in  the settlement project have theological significance in the Jewish Hebron community: the frictions of war were, in Kook's view, conducive to the messianic process, and 'Arabs' will have to leave. There is no kin connection between the new settlers and the traditional Old Families of Jewish Hebronites, who vigorously oppose the new settler presence in Hebron.&lt;ref name =&quot;Røislien&quot;/&gt; According to a ruling given by the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in 2011, Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron and Tel Rumeida before 1948, and have no right to compensation for their losses.&lt;ref name =Levinsohn2011&gt;Chaim Levinsohn, [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-supreme-court-rules-hebron-jews-can-t-reclaim-lands-lost-after-1948-1.344090 'Israel Supreme Court Rules Hebron Jews Can't Reclaim Lands Lost After 1948 ,'] [[Haaretz]] 18 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First settlement, Kiryat Arba ===
In the spring of 1968, Rabbi [[Moshe Levinger]], together with a group of Israelis posing as Swiss tourists, rented from its owner [[Qawasameh tribe|Faiz Qawasmeh]] &lt;ref&gt;Ami Pedahzur, Arie Perliger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DF03xwLaPucC&amp;pg=PA69 ''Jewish Terrorism in Israel,''] Columbia University Press, 2011 p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; the main hotel in Hebron&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then refused to leave. The [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor government]]'s survival depended on the [[religious Zionism]]-associated [[National Religious Party]] and was, under pressure of this party, reluctant to evacuate the settlers. Defence Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] ordered their evacuation but agreed to their relocation to the nearby military base on the eastern outskirts of Hebron which was to become the settlement [[Kiryat Arba]].&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12&gt;[http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/opt_prot_aic_hebron_dec_2004.pdf ''Occupation in Hebron''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105174717/http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/opt_prot_aic_hebron_dec_2004.pdf |date=2016-01-05 }}, pp. 10–12. Alternative Information Center, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After heavy lobbying by Levinger, the settlement gained the tacit support of [[Levi Eshkol]] and [[Yigal Allon]], while it was opposed by [[Abba Eban]] and [[Pinhas Sapir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=137, 144, 150, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a year and a half, the government agreed to legitimize the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=205, 359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was later expanded with the nearby [[Israeli outpost|outpost]] Givat Ha’avot, north of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]].&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt; 
Much of the Hebron-Kiryat Arba operation was planned and financed by the [[Movement for Greater Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lustick|1988|p=205 n.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beit Hadassah ===
Originally named Hesed l'Avraham clinic, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Jewish [[Baghdad]]i families and was the only modern medical facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America]] which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all.&lt;ref name = HebronJews/&gt;

In 1979, after several attempts by Israeli men had failed to succeed in taking possession of the building, then known as the Dabouia, 15 settler mothers and their 35 children drove down to it and [[Squatting|squatted]] there, and managed to camp in the building for a year, exploiting the government's indecision at the time, when it was engaged in [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|negotiations with Egypt]] to hand back the [[Sinai peninsula]] The calculation was that the state would 'balance out' the unpopular decision to hand back conquered territory by committing itself to greater control of the West Bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuman&quot; &gt;Tamara Neuman,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWtZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79 ''Settling Hebron: Jewish Fundamentalism in a Palestinian City:The Ethnography of Political Violence,''] [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2018   {{isbn|978-0-812-29482-8}} pp.79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; a group of settlers led by Miriam Levinger moved into the Dabouia, the former [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Hospital]] in central Hebron, then under Arab administration. They turned it into a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement inside Hebron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perera|1996|pp=178}}: 'As I made my way to the Machpelah, I passed a curious scene. The Hadassah hospital of Hebron, which is Arab-administered, had been taken over by Israeli women of Kiryat Arba, the new settlement on the hill overlooking the city. Miriam Levinger, wife of Moshe Levinger, the militant right-wing rabbi who founded Kiryat Arba, was screaming in her Brooklyn-accented Hebrew at the Palestinian police, who were – very politely – attempting to remove the women from the hospital grounds.'&lt;/ref&gt; and founded the [[Committee of The Jewish Community of Hebron]] near the Abraham Avinu Synagogue. The take-over created severe conflict with Arab shopkeepers in the same area, and a retaliatory action by a Palestinian guerilla group which killed six [[yeshiva]] students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Ehrenreich]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fqY9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT254 ''The Way to the Spring: Life and Death in Palestine,''] [[Granta Books]]2016 {{isbn|978-1-783-78312-0}} p.156.&lt;/ref&gt; The shopkeepers appealed twice to the Israeli Supreme Court, without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kretzmer|2002|pp=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this precedent, in February of the following year, the Government legitimized residency in the city of Hebron proper, allowing 50 armed families under military guard to dwell in a fortified structure in the heart of  the Old City of Palestinian Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Falah|1985|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuman&quot; /&gt; The pattern of settlement followed by an outbreak of hostilities with local Palestinians was repeated later at Tel Rumeida.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bouckaert|2001|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beit Romano ===
Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a Yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students.&lt;ref name = HebronJews&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auerbach|first1=Jerold S.|title=Hebron Jews memory and conflict in the land of Israel|date=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780742566170|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooUqc8snyZUC&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt;

=== Tel Rumeida ===
In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further  800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in [[Tel Rumeida]]. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Platt|2012|pp=79–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called (''Ramat Yeshai''). In 1998, the Government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units.&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt;

=== Avraham Avinu ===
[[File:Abraham Avinu Synagogue, Hebron.jpg|thumb|Abraham Avinu Synagogue in 1925]]
The [[Abraham Avinu Synagogue]] was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the centre of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down in 1929. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auerbach|first1=Jerold S.|title=Hebron Jews memory and conflict in the land of Israel|date=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780742566170|pages=40, 45, 79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooUqc8snyZUC&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on [[Al-Shuhada Street]] in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighbouring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return.&lt;ref name=AIC_2004_10-12/&gt;

=== Further settlement activities ===
In 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Chaim. [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-brass-calls-for-immediate-removal-of-new-hebron-settlement-1.422007 &quot;IDF brass calls for immediate removal of new Hebron settlement.&quot;] ''Haaretz Newspaper''. 2 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF has enforced settler demands against the flying of Palestinian flags on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Levinson, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.580203 'Following settlers' demand, IDF removes Palestinian flag from Hebron roof,'] [[Haaretz]], March 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of ''Plugat Hamitkanim'' in Hebron, which had been confiscated for military purposes in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=772789 'Watchdog: Expansion of Hebron settlements amounts to ‘right of return for Jews only,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 22 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2019, the Israeli Defense Minister [[Naftali Bennett]] instructed the [[Israeli Civil Administration|military administration]] to inform the Palestinian municipality of the government's intention to reconstruct infrastructure in the old Hebron fruit and vegetable market in order to establish a Jewish neighbourhood there, which would allow for doubling the city's settler population. The area's original residents, who have protected tenancy rights there, were compelled to evacuate the zone after the Cave of the Patriarch's massacre. The original site was under Jewish ownership prior to 1948. The plan proposes that the empty shops remain Palestinian while the units built over them house Jewish Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;Hagar Shezaf, [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-plans-new-jewish-neighborhood-in-hebron-s-abandoned-arab-market-1.8201992 'Israel Plans New Jewish Neighborhood in Hebron’s Arab Market,'] [[Haaretz]] 1 December 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisha Ben Kimon, Yoav Zitun, Elior Levy, [https://www.ynetnews.com/article/HJOLZK11ar  Bennett plans building Jewish neighborhood in Hebron] [[Ynet]] 1 December 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yumna Patel,[https://mondoweiss.net/2019/12/israels-plan-to-build-new-settlement-atop-old-hebron-market-evokes-painful-memories-for-residents/ 'Israel’s plan to build new settlement atop Hebron market evokes painful memories for residents,'] [[Mondoweiss]] 4 December 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
In 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnerp261&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|1820|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Hebron had an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, in addition to 41 Jewish tax-payers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under 'European protections'. The total population was estimated at 10,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson 88&quot;/&gt; In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the latter having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;PackardUnion1842&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick Adolphus Packard|author2=American Sunday-School Union|title=The Union Bible Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qAaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA304|year=1842|publisher=American Sunday-School Union|page=304|quote=About four hundred families of Arabs dwell in Hebron, and about one hundred and twenty families of Jews; the latter having been greatly reduced in number by a bloody battle in 1834, between them and the troops of Ibrahim Pasha.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban development==
[[File:Hebron City-1.jpg|thumb|250px|View of Hebron 2006]]

Historically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the ''suq'' and ''Harat al-Masharqa'' adjacent to the Ibrahimi mosque, the silk merchant quarter (''Haret Kheitun'') to the south and the Sheikh quarter (''Haret al-Sheikh'') to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Cesari 2009 235–236&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|De Cesari|2009|pp=235–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Cesari 2009 235–236&quot;/&gt; The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the cave of Machpelah, the ''Haret Kheitun'' (the Jewish quarter, ''Haret el-Yahud''), the ''Haret el-Sheikh'' and the [[Druze]] quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Rx2bSALkAC&amp;pg=PA395 Journal of a deputation sent to the East by the committee of the Malta Protestant college, in 1849: containing an account of the present state of the Oriental nations, including their religion, learning, education, customs, and occupations, Volume 2], J. Nisbet and co., 1854. p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Hebron's population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighbourhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial centre, ''Bab el-Zawiye'', emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Efrat|1984|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kedar 2000 112–113&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kedar|2000|pp=112–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: ''el-Sheikh'' and ''Bab el-Zawiye'' to the west, ''el-Kazzazin'', ''el-Akkabi'' and ''el-Haram'' in the centre, ''el-Musharika'' to the south and ''el-Kheitun'' in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brill|1993|p=887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kedar 2000 112–113&quot;/&gt; The large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over {{convert|3|mi|0|abbr=out}} at a depth of 600&amp;nbsp;ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=&quot;Efrat 1984 192&quot;/&gt;

In 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the [[Hebron University]], an Islamic university, was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebron.edu/en/about-hu/hu-founder.html About Founder of Hebron University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016234433/http://www.hebron.edu/en/about-hu/hu-founder.html |date=2012-10-16 }}, Hebron University, 2010–2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A ghetto state of ghettos: Palestinians under Israeli citizenship'', Mary Boger, City University of New York. Sociology – 2008. p. 93: &quot;The development of the Islamic Movement in Israel owes much to the Israeli and Jordanian governments who collaborated to establish an Islamic University in al-Khalil (Hebron), headed by Shaykh Muhammad Ali al-Ja'bari a prominent anti-PLO leader who served as minister in Jordan and in the internal circle of kings Abd-allah and Husayn, who are known to have befriended the Israeli occupation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ricca|2007|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auerbach|2009|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hebronmarket.jpg|thumb|right|Hebron market]]
Today, the area along the north-south axis to the east comprises the modern town of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, ''Khalil Foq''). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who from there from the crowded old city, ''Balde al-Qadime'' (also called Lower Hebron, ''Khalil Takht'').&lt;ref name=&quot;De Cesari 2009 230–233&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|De Cesari|2009|pp=230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential  districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the ''krum'', rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Cesari 2009 230–233&quot;/&gt; The southern part is where the working-class neighbourhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Cesari 2009 230–233&quot;/&gt;

The main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the centre of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron's domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads which lead to the entrance of the old city.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Cesari 2009 230–233&quot;/&gt;  Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial centre of the city, known as the vegetable market (''hesbe''), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of ''Bab el-Zawiye''.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Cesari 2009 230–233&quot;/&gt;

==Shoe industry==
From the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJShoe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2015/03/decline-hebron-shoe-industry-150302125843692.html|title=The decline of Hebron's shoe industry|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMShoe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ru/originals/2013/03/palestinian-industry-suffers-cheap-imports.htm|title=The decline of Hebron's shoe industry|work=[[Al Monitor]]|date=13 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] and 1994 [[Protocol on Economic Relations]] between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, said more is still needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJShoe&quot;/&gt; The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMShoe&quot;/&gt;

90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper,&lt;ref name=&quot;AJShoe&quot;/&gt; and the Chinese are more aesthetic. Another factor contributing to the decline of the local industry is Israeli restrictions on Palestinian exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMShoe&quot;/&gt;

Today, there are less than 300 workshops in the shoe industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people. More than 50% of the shoes are exported to Israel, where consumers have a better economy. Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJShoe&quot;/&gt;

==Political status==
[[File:Hebron redeployment 1997.jpg|thumbnail|Map of Hebron showing Palestinian controlled H1 and Israeli controlled H2.]]
Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the [[Arab Higher Committee]] in Palestine and the [[Arab League]]) rejected it, opposing any partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Palestinian refugees in Jordan 1948–1957|last=Plascov|first=Avi|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-3120-2|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daLPXTYcoewC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jerusalem question, 1917–1968|last=Bovis|first=H.

Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|Hebron Agreement]], Israel withdrew from 80 per cent of Hebron which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.

An international unarmed observer force—the [[Temporary International Presence in Hebron]] (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the [[Israeli Civil Administration]], and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an [[Israeli settler]], and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.&lt;ref name=20yrs /&gt;

==Intercommunal violence==
{{Main|Israeli–Palestinian conflict in Hebron}}
Hebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the [[Palestinian Authority]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimmerling 2003 443&quot;/&gt; Since The [[Oslo Agreement]], violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]] took place on February 25, 1994 when [[Baruch Goldstein]], an Israeli physician and resident of [[Kiryat Arba]], opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the [[Ibrahimi Mosque]], killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Nabeel Abraham,  [http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/articles/article0002775.html What About The Victims?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192614/http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/articles/article0002775.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, Lies of Our Times, May 1994, pp 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bovard|2004|p=265}}.Meir Tayar, commander of the Hebron Border Police at the time testified that, 'Instructions are to take cover, wait until the clip is empty or the gun jams and then overpower him. Even if I had been there (in the mosque), I could not have done anything-there were special orders.'&lt;/ref&gt; This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] party was banned as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Commission of Inquiry|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedland|2012|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the period of the [[First Intifada]] and [[Second Intifada]], the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and [[second Intifada]] (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada,&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa.gov.il&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+before+2000/Fatal+Terrorist+Attacks+in+Israel+Since+the+DOP+-S.htm|title=Fatal Terrorist Attacks in Israel Since the DOP (Sep. 1993)|date=24 September 2000|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=[[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighbourhoods. 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harel|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two [[Temporary International Presence in Hebron]] observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200203/s514316.htm Two Norwegian observers killed near Hebron: Israeli TV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021161007/http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200203/s514316.htm |date=2007-10-21 }}, ABC News online, March 27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Published: 7:31PM GMT 26 Mar 2002 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1388887/Two-Norwegian-observers-killed-near-Hebron.html |title=Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2002-03-26 |accessdate=2009-11-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiph.org/en/News/?module=Articles;action=Article.publicShow;ID=1579 Two TIPH members killed near Hebron] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223944/http://www.tiph.org/en/News/?module=Articles;action=Article.publicShow;ID=1579 |date=2007-09-27 }}, Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron website, March 27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby [[Murder of Shalhevet Pass|Shalhevet Pass]].

The Old Town of Hebron was a declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] on 7 July 2017,&lt;ref name=&quot;OldTownofHebron&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Adamczyk |first=Ed |title=UNESCO declares Hebron, West Bank, a world heritage site |work= |pages= |language=English |publisher=UPI |date=7 July 2017 |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/07/07/UNESCO-declares-Hebron-West-Bank-a-world-heritage-site/3011499431429/ |accessdate=7 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but caused outrage by Israeli officials when the World Heritage Committee declared it a Palestinian World Heritage Site instead of an Israeli or Jewish one.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC UNESCO&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/unesco-puts-city-hebron-heritage-danger-list-48495103 | title=Israelis outraged by UNESCO decision on Hebron holy site | publisher=ABC News | work=Associated Press | date=7 July 2017 | accessdate=8 July 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707222506/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/unesco-puts-city-hebron-heritage-danger-list-48495103 | archive-date=7 July 2017 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous historic site in Hebron is the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. The [[Herodian architecture|Herodian era structure]] is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical [[Patriarchs]] and [[Matriarchs (Bible)|Matriarchs]]. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue. The tombs of other biblical figures ([[Abner|Abner ben Ner]], [[Othniel|Otniel ben Kenaz]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] and [[Jesse]]) are also located in the city.

The [[Oak of Sibta]] (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finn|1868|p=184}}:'the great oak of Sibta, commonly called Abraham’s oak by most people except the Jews, who do not believe in any Abraham’s oak there. The great patriarch planted, indeed, a grove at Beersheba; but the “Eloné Mamre” they declare to have been “plains,” not “oaks,” (which would be Alloné Mamre,) and to have been situated northwards instead of westwards from the present Hebron.'&lt;/ref&gt; is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] owns the site and the nearby [[Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery]], consecrated in 1925.

Hebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its [[Mamluk architecture]]. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Museum With No Frontiers|title=Pilgrimage, sciences and Sufism: Islamic art in the West Bank and Gaza|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bqMVAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Édisud|isbn=978-9953-36-064-5|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosques from the era include the [[Sheikh Ali al-Bakka Mosque|Sheikh Ali al-Bakka]] and [[Al-Jawali Mosque|Al-Jawali]] mosque. The early Ottoman [[Abraham Avinu Synagogue]] in the city's historic Jewish quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.

==Religious traditions==
Some Jewish traditions regarding [[Adam]] place him in Hebron after his expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]. Another has [[Cain]] kill [[Abel]] there. A third has [[Adam and Eve]] buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vilnay 1973 170–172&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Vilnay|1973|pp=170–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bSpJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 Miscellanies of divinitie: divided into three books] Edward Kellet, 1633. p. 223: &quot;Sixthly, the field of Damascus, where the red earth lieth, of which they report Adam was formed; which earth is tough, and may be wrought like wax, and lieth close by Hebron.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Milwright|title=The Fortress of the Raven: Karak in the Middle Islamic Period (1100 -1650)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7w7TW4NVBcC&amp;pg=PA119|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16519-9|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

It is thus possibly the birthplace of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Craveri|1967|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milman|1840|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Islamic tradition has it that the Prophet alighted in Hebron during his [[Isra and Mi'raj|night journey]] from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition states that the prophet Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of [[Tamim al-Dari]]'s domain; this was implemented during [[Umar]]'s reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the ''[[waqf]]'' of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levi della Vida|1993|p=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''simat al-Khalil'' or &quot;Table of Abraham&quot; is attested to in the writings of the 11th century [[Persian people|Persian]] traveller [[Nasir-i Khusraw]]. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center — which predates the Ottoman ''[[imaret]]s'' — gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of [[lentil]]s in [[olive oil]], and some [[raisins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-136-49894-7| last = Woodhead| first = Christine| title = The Ottoman World| page=73 |date = 2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin towns/Sister cities==
Hebron is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:
