'''Geocaching''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|oʊ|ˌ|k|æ|ʃ|ɪ|ŋ}} is an outdoor recreational activity, in which participants use a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) [[GPS navigation device|receiver]] or [[mobile device]] and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called &quot;geocaches&quot; or &quot;caches&quot;, at specific locations marked by [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/guide/default.aspx|title=Geocaching - The Official Global GPS Cache Hunt Site|last=Geocaching|website=Geocaching|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a [[logbook]] and sometimes a pen or pencil. The geocacher signs the log with their established code name and dates it, in order to prove that they found the cache. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it.  Larger containers such as plastic storage containers ([[Tupperware#Product lines|Tupperware]] or similar) or [[Ammo box|ammunition boxes]] can also contain items for trading, such as toys or trinkets, usually of more sentimental worth than financial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geocaching/|title=geocaching|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=[[National Geographic Society]]|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geocaching shares many aspects with [[Benchmarking (geolocating)|benchmarking]], trigpointing, [[orienteering]], [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure-hunting]], [[Letterboxing (hobby)|letterboxing]], [[waymarking]] and [[Munzee]].

==History==
[[File:The location of the first Geocache, east of Portland.gif|thumb|A. 360° panoramic view of  the site of the first geocache, placed by Dave Ulmer. |225x225px]]

Geocaching was originally similar to the 160-year-old game [[Letterboxing (hobby)|letterboxing]], which uses clues and references to [[landmarks]] embedded in stories. Geocaching was conceived shortly after the removal of [[Selective Availability]] from the [[Global Positioning System]] on May 2, 2000, because the improved accuracy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/ |title=U.S Government: GPS accuracy |publisher=Gps.gov |date=February 17, 2012 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the system allowed for a small container to be specifically placed and located. The first documented placement of a GPS-located cache took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer of [[Beavercreek, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/about/history.aspx|title=The History of Geocaching|last=|first=|date=|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=Groundspeak|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location was posted on the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] sci.geo.satellite-nav&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulmer&quot;&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=GPS Stash Hunt... Stash #1 is there! |author=Dave Ulmer |date=May 3, 2000 |newsgroup=sci.geo.satellite-nav |message-id=02b45318.39d4645b@usw-ex0102-084.remarq.com |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sci.geo.satellite-nav/mchHczyzVHo/p_SzccG87HgJ |accessdate=March 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at {{Coord|45|17.460|N|122|24.800|W |region:US-OR_type:landmark}}. Within three days, the cache had been found twice, first by Mike Teague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2009/04/29/geocaching_feature.shtml|title=Geocaching|last=Parry|first=Cristina|date=2009-04-29|work=[[BBC News]] Oxford|access-date=2019-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dave Ulmer's message, this cache was a black plastic bucket that was partially buried and contained software, videos, books, money, a can of [[Baked beans|beans]], and a [[slingshot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulmer&quot;/&gt; [[File:&quot;Original Can of Beans&quot; from first geocache.jpg|thumb|&quot;Original Can of Beans&quot; at the 2012 Geocoinfest Mega Event in Colorado.]]
The geocache and most of its contents were eventually destroyed by a [[lawn mower]]; the can of beans was the only item salvaged and was turned into a [[Trackable|trackable item]] called the &quot;Original Can of Beans&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?id=83154|title=O.C.B.©|last=|first=|date=2003-09-07|website=Geocaching.com|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another geocache and plaque called the Original Stash Tribute Plaque&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coord.info/GCGV0P|title=GCGV0P- Original Stash Tribute Plaque|last=|first=|date=2003-09-07|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=Geocaching HQ|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; now sit at the site.

Groundspeak allows extraterrestrial caches, e.g. the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]], although presently, the website provides only earthbound coordinates. Only one geocache has ever been extraterrestrial: GC1BE91, which was on the [[International Space Station]] between 2008 as 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=gc1be91|title=GC1BE91 International Space Station|last=|first=|date=|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used the launch area [[Baikonur]] in Kazakhstan as its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/map/#?ll=45.95357,63.34176&amp;z=14 |title=Geocaching map |publisher=geocaching.com |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity was originally referred to as the ''GPS stash hunt'' or ''gpsstashing.'' This was changed shortly after the original hide when it was suggested in the gpsstash [[eGroups|eGroup]] that &quot;stash&quot; could have negative connotations and the term ''geocaching'' was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cache vs Stash |first=Matt|last=Stum |date=May 30, 2000 |url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/gpsstash/message/62 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, a variety of different hide-and-seek-type activities have been created or abandoned, so that &quot;geocaching&quot; may now refer to hiding and seeking containers, or locations or information without containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234769555_Hide_And_Seek_GPS_And_Geocaching_In_The_Classroom|title=Hide And Seek GPS And Geocaching In The Classroom {{!}} Download Citation|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent accounting of the early history documents several controversial actions taken by Irish and Grounded, Inc., a predecessor to Groundspeak, to increase &quot;commercialization and monopolistic control over the hobby&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geocaching.gpsgames.org/history/ The History of Geocaching] ''GPSgames.org;'' retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, other similar hobbies such as [[Munzee]] have attracted some geocachers by rapidly adopting smart-phone technology, which has caused &quot;some resistance from geocaching organizers about placing caches along with Munzees&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Susan|title=New game in town, Nerds gain more revenge with Munzee|url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121110/NEWS/111109916/1246|accessdate=January 20, 2013|newspaper=TELEGRAM &amp; GAZETTE|date=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geocaches==
[[File:Classic Geocache.jpg|thumb|A classic geocache – trade items in a military ammunition box.|225x225px]]
For the traditional geocache, a geocacher will place a waterproof container containing a log book (with [[pen]] and/or [[pencil]]) and trade items or [[Travel Bug|trackables]], then record the cache's [[Latitude and longitude|coordinates]]. These coordinates, along with other details of the location, are posted on a [[website|listing site]] (see list of some sites below). Other geocachers obtain the coordinates from that listing site and seek out the cache using their handheld GPS receivers. The finding geocachers record their exploits in the logbook and online, but then must return the cache to the same coordinates so that other geocachers may find it. Geocachers are free to take objects (except the logbook, pencil, or stamp) from the cache in exchange for leaving something of similar or higher value.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryfile.com/explore-countryside/beginners-guide-geocaching|title=The beginners' guide to geocaching|last=|first=|date=2015-02-12|website=|publisher=Countryfile Magazine|access-date=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Geocaching Geocoin.png|left|thumb|An &quot;Ace&quot; [[Geocoin]].]]
Typical cache &quot;treasures&quot;, also known in the geocaching world as swag,&lt;ref name=&quot;Geocaching&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx|title=Glossary of Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc.|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not high in monetary value but may hold personal value to the finder.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual [[coin]]s or [[currency]], small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal [[Geocoin]]s, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geocaching&quot;/&gt; [[Disposable cameras]] are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache to take a picture which can be developed and uploaded to a Geocaching web site listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=Erik|title=Geocaching hike and seek with your gps|date=2004|publisher=APRESS|location=Berkeley|isbn=1-59059-122-4|page=19|edition=Steve Anglin}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called &quot;hitchhikers&quot;, such as [[Travel Bug]]s or [[Geocoin]]s, whose travels may be logged and followed online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond-news.com/news/weekly-feature/pokemon-who-richmond-geocachers-are-the-real-life-scavenger-hunters-1.2326716|title=Pokemon who? Richmond geocachers are the real life scavenger hunters|last=News|first=Hedy Ng/Special to the|newspaper=Richmond News|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called &quot;FTF&quot;), or in locations which are harder to reach. [[File:Food in geocache.jpg|thumb|A granola bar in a geocache in England. Even if sealed, food is not allowed in geocaches, as it is considered unhygienic and can attract animals.]] Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.

If a geocache has been vandalized or stolen, it is said to have been &quot;muggled&quot;. The former term plays off the fact that those not familiar with geocaching are called [[muggle]]s, a term borrowed from the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of books which was rising in popularity at the same time geocaching got its start.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geocaching&quot; /&gt;

===Variations===
Traditional geocaching gave birth to [[Encounter (game)#GeoCaching|GeoCaching]] – an active urban game of the [[Encounter (game)|Encounter]] project. The game is quite similar to geocaching but has time limitations and hints.

Geocaches vary in size, difficulty, and location. Simple caches that are placed near a roadside are often called &quot;drive-bys&quot;, &quot;park 'n grabs&quot; (PNGs), or &quot;cache and dash&quot;. Geocaches may also be complex, involving lengthy searches, significant travel, or use of specialist equipment such as [[SCUBA diving]], [[kayaking]], or [[abseiling]].  Different geocaching websites list different variations per their own policies.
[[File:Geocache containers range.jpg|thumb|Geocaches come in a range of sizes. Top: a [[magnetic nano]] geocache in the [[City of London]]. &lt;Br/&gt; 
 Bottom: A large bucket geocache in the [[Czech Republic]].]]
Container sizes range from &quot;nanos&quot;, particularly [[magnetic nano]]s, which can be smaller than the tip of a finger and have only enough room to store the log sheet, to 20-liter (5 gallon) buckets or even larger containers, such as entire trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocaching.com/blog/2015/06/gigantesque-the-big-one-gc5q8n-geocache-of-the-week/ | title=gigantesque – The Big One (GC5Q8N) – Geocache of the Week | first=Derek | last=H | date=June 25, 2015 | accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cache containers in rural areas are lunch-box-sized plastic storage containers or surplus military ammunition cans. [[ammunition box|Ammo cans]] are considered the gold standard of containers because they are very sturdy, waterproof, animal- and fire-resistant, and relatively cheap, and have plenty of room for trade items. Smaller containers are more common in urban areas because they can be more easily hidden.

=== Geocache types ===
Over time many variations of geocaches have developed. Different platforms often have their own rules on which types are allowed or how they are classified. The following cache types are supported by both geocaching.com and opencaching.us unless stated otherwise.

A '''Traditional cache''' is the most common type and consists of a container with a logbook. Exact coordinates where the cache is located are given.&lt;ref name=&quot;geo_types&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx|title=Geocache types|last=|first=|date=|website=geocaching.com|publisher=Groundspeak|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters|title=Cache Parameters|last=|first=|date=|website=wiki.opencaching.us|publisher=Opencaching Network|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Multi-cache''' consists of one or more stages, each of them containing the coordinates for the next one; the final stage contains a physical container with the logbook.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt; An '''Offset cache''' is a multi-cache in which the initial coordinates are for a location containing information that encodes the final cache coordinates. An example would be to direct the finder to a plaque where the digits of a date on the plaque correspond to coordinates of the final cache.

'''Mystery/puzzle caches''' require one to discover information or solve a puzzle to find the cache. Some mystery caches provide a puzzle that must be solved to determine the physical cache location. Caches which do not fit into other categories are classified as mystery caches.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;

'''Challenge caches''' require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day. On geocaching.com it is considered a subtype of the Mystery cache, while it is a type on its own on opencaching.us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&amp;id=127&amp;pgid=206|title=Challenge caches|website=geocaching.com|publisher=Groundspeak|access-date=2019-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Night cache''' is multi-stage and intended to be found at night by following a series of reflectors with a flashlight to the final cache location. Considered a variant of the Mystery cache on ''geoocaching.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&amp;id=127&amp;pgid=69|title=Night and UV Caches|publisher=Groundspeak|access-date=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Chirp cache''' is a Garmin-created innovative advance on multi-caches using new wireless beacon technology. The Chirp stores hints, multicache coordinates, counts visitors and confirms the cache is nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://garmin.blogs.com/my_weblog/2010/10/garmin-chirp-brings-geocachers-even-more-creativity-connectivity.html Garmin chirp Brings Geocachers Even More Creativity, Connectivity], published October 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=74811&amp;pvID=75243 Garmin Chirp], retrieved January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These caches were fully supported at OpenCaching.com, but they caused considerable discussion and some controversy at Groundspeak, where they were given a new &quot;attribute&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=261919&amp;st=150&amp;p=4504653&amp;#entry4504653 Garmin Chirp- Geocaching Beacon], retrieved January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Wherigo cache''' is a multi-stage cache hunt that uses a Wherigo &quot;cartridge&quot; to guide the player to find a physical cache sometime during cartridge play, usually at the end. Not all Wherigo cartridges incorporate geocaches into game play. Wherigo caches are unique to the geocaching.com website.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt; '''Wherigo''' is a [[GPS]] location-aware software platform  initially released in January 2008. Authors can develop self-enclosed story files (called &quot;cartridges&quot;) that are read by the Wherigo player software, installed on either a GPS unit or smartphone. The player and story take advantage of the location information provided by the GPS to trigger in-game events, such as using a virtual object or interacting with characters. Completing an adventure can require reaching different locations and solving puzzles. Cartridges are coded in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].  Lua may be used directly, but a builder application is usually used. The Wherigo site&lt;ref name=&quot;Wherigo website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wherigo.com/about.aspx|title=Wherigo &gt; About the Wherigo Platform|work=Wherigo.com|publisher=[[Groundspeak]]|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a builder application and a database of adventures free for download, though the builder has remained in its Alpha version since its last release in May 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;builder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wherigo.com/builder/default.aspx|title=Wherigo Builder|work=Wherigo.com|publisher=[[Groundspeak]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official player is only available for [[Pocket PC]].  A built-in player is available on [[Garmin]] Colorado and Oregon GPS models. The Wherigo Foundation&lt;ref name=&quot;Wherigo Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wherigofoundation.com/foundation/|title=Wherigo Foundation|work=WherigoFoundation.com|publisher=WherigoFoundation|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was organized in December 2012.  The group is composed of all Wherigo application developers who, up until that time, had been acting and developing separately.  Their goal is to provide a consistent Wherigo experience across platforms, connect Wherigo applications via an API, and add modern features to the Wherigo platform.  While Groundspeak is aware of this project, the company has yet to take a position.

A '''[[letterboxing (hobby)|Letterbox]] cache''' or a '''Letterbox hybrid cache''' is a combination of a geocache and a letterbox in the same container. A letterbox has a rubber stamp and a logbook instead of tradable items. Letterboxers carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox's log book and inversely stamp their personal log book with the letterbox stamp. The hybrid cache contains the important materials for this and may or may not include trade items.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt;

'''Moving/travelling caches''' are found at a listed set of coordinates. The finder hides the cache in a different location, and updates the listing, essentially becomes the hider, and the next finder continues the cycle. This cache type is supported at opencaching.us while it has been discontinued at geocaching.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&amp;id=127&amp;pgid=890|title=The history of traveling caches|website=geocaching.com|access-date=2019-09-08|publisher=Groundspeak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guest Book caches''' use guest books often found in museums, tourist information centers, etc. They are listed exclusively at opencaching.us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt;

The following cache types don't contain a physical logbook.
[[File:Virtual Cache.JPG|thumb|A Geocacher finding a Virtual Cache at [[McMurdo Station]], [[Antarctica]].|225x225px]]

A '''BIT cache''' is a laminated card with a QR code, similar to [[Munzee]]. The BIT Cache also contains a URL and a password, for logging purposes. They are listed exclusively on opencaching.us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OPENCACHING Geocaching in North America |url=http://www.opencaching.us/ |title=opencaching.us |publisher=opencaching.us |date= |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitcaching.com/ BITcaching.com], retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtual caches''' are coordinates for a location, which has some other described object. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with information such as a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with GPS receiver in hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt; New virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,&lt;ref name=&quot;geocaching.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx Geocache Listing Requirements / Guidelines], retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain supported by other sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt; The Groundspeak website no longer lists new caches without a physical container, including virtual and webcam caches; however, older caches of these types have been [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in (except for locationless/reverse, which are completely archived). On August 24, 2017, Groundspeak announced &quot;Virtual Rewards&quot;, allowing 4000 new virtual caches to be placed during the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2017/08/virtual-rewards/ |title=Virtual Rewards |publisher=geocaching.com |accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthcaches are one of the two exceptions to the no-container rule; they are caches in which players must answer geological questions to complete the cache. The other exception is for event caches; for an event to qualify, it must be specifically or mainly for geocachers, and must have a minimum duration dependent upon its category (CITO, regular, Mega, or Giga).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&amp;id=23 |title=Calendars and Events (regular, mega, CITO) |publisher=Groundspeak.com |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees of event caches can log that they 'attended', which will increment their number of found caches. Groundspeak created a waymarking website to handle all other non-physical caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=401 |title=Virtual Geocaches |publisher=Groundspeak.com |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earthcaches''' are virtual caches that are organized by the [[Geological Society of America]]. The cacher usually has to perform a task which teaches an educational lesson about the earth science of the cache area. They are listed at geocaching.com.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;

'''Locationless/reverse caches''' are similar to a [[scavenger hunt]]. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates an example of this object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;

'''Webcam caches''' are virtual caches whose coordinates have a public [[webcam]]. The finder is often required to capture their image from the webcam for verification of the find.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt; New webcam caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,&lt;ref name=&quot;geocaching.com&quot;/&gt; but they remain supported by opencaching.us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt;

Finally, a '''USB Cache''' or '''[[USB dead drop|Dead Drop]] cache''' location has a USB drive embedded into walls or other structures. The cache is retrieved by connecting a device that has a USB port and that is able to read standard text files. This type is available at opencaching.us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cache Parameters&quot;/&gt;

{{Anchor|eventcache}}
There are a few kinds of events.

An '''Event Cache''' is a gathering organized and attended by geocachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;geo_types&quot; /&gt;

'''Cache-In Trash-Out (CITO) Events''' are coordinated activities of trash pickup and other maintenance tasks (such as constructing footpaths, planting trees and removing invasive species) to improve the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;geo_types&quot; /&gt; CITO is an ongoing environmental initiative created by Groundspeak Inc. related to geocaching which encourages geocachers to clean up parks and other areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;geo_types&quot; /&gt; This is done in two ways: specific events, traditionally around the time of [[Earth Day]] each year,&lt;ref name=&quot;CITO video link on geocaching blog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.geocaching.com/2010/05/geocaching-coms-lost-found-video-cache-in-trash-out/|title=Cache In Trash Out – Geocaching.com’s Lost &amp; Found Video|last=Schudiske|first=Eric|date=May 25, 2010|publisher=blog.geocaching.com|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which groups go around picking up [[litter]] and maintaining the landscape while finding geocaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Page on geocaching.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/cito/|title=Geocaching &gt; Cache In Trash Out|publisher=geocaching.com|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/geocaching-photos_n_5850714|title=Oh The Places You'll Go: Geocaching Takes Adventurers To Beautiful, New Spots Every Day|last=Boehrer, McGonial|first=Katherine, Chris|date=2014-09-28|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Mega Event''' is defined by attendance of over 500 people. Mega Events are typically annual events, usually attracting geocachers from all over the world.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;

A '''Giga Event''' is an event with an attendance of over 5000 people, also attracting geocachers from worldwide.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;

Finally, a '''GPS Adventures Maze Exhibit''' is an exhibit at various museums and science centers in which participants in the maze learn about geocaching. These &quot;events&quot; have their own cache type on geocaching.com and include many non-geocachers.&lt;ref name = &quot;geo_types&quot;/&gt;

====Geodashing====
Geodashing is an outdoor [[sport]] in which teams of players use [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers to find and visit randomly selected &quot;dashpoints&quot; (also called &quot;waypoints&quot;) around the world and report what they find. The objective is to visit as many dashpoints as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmidt | first=Jeremy |date=January 6, 2002| title=Scavenger hunts turn high-tech| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| page= H4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tipton| first=Nancy |date=July 24, 2005|title= In search of cache| work= [[Albuquerque Journal]]| page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike geocaching, nothing is to be left at the dashpoints; the sole objective is to visit them within the time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsgames.org/cgi-bin/gpswiki.pl?GeodashingIntro |title=Introduction to Geodashing |publisher=Gpsgames.org |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lange|first= Linda |date=February 9, 2003|title= A global treasure hunt| work=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]| page= F2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game, organized by gpsgames.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org |title=gpsgames.org |publisher=gpsgames.org |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ran for two months (June and July 2001); each subsequent game has run for one month. Players are often encouraged to take pictures at the dashpoints and upload them to the site.

====Stratocaching====
Geocaching from space is a combination of flight to near space, the geocaching game, and a unique science experiment. The first Stratocaching event was held on 16 November 2013 in Prague and was successful. Ten caches and two &quot;radioseeds&quot; went up to {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} into the stratosphere on a gondola called Dropion module carried by a high-altitude balloon. The caches and seeds then fell to earth for people to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet.idnes.cz/first-stratocaching-2013-prague-czech-republic-geocaching-near-space-game-13m-/tec_vesmir.aspx?c=A131118_172217_tec_vesmir_pka|title=VIDEO: First Stratocaching attracted 200k Czechs with a near-space treasure hunt|author=Pavel Kasík|date=November 18, 2013|work=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXTvBBQfLfE|title=Stratocaching (EN)|date=November 15, 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet.idnes.cz/stratocaching-geocaching-from-space-experiment-prague-czech-republic-1kk-/tec_vesmir.aspx?c=A131115_171153_tec_vesmir_pka|title=New GPS game is out of this world: Czechs are introducing Stratocaching|author=Pavel Kasík|date=November 15, 2013|work=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
===Obtaining data===
GPX files containing information such as a cache description and information about recent visitors to the cache are available from various listing sites. Geocachers may upload geocache data (also known as [[waypoint]]s) from various websites in various formats, most commonly in file-type [[GPX (data transfer)|GPX]], which uses [[XML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GPX: The GPS Exchange Format |url=http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some websites allow geocachers to search (build queries) for multiple caches within a geographic area based on criteria such as [[ZIP code]] or [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]], downloading the results as an email attachment on a schedule. In recent years, Android and iPhone users have been able to download apps such as GeoBeagle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=geobeagleteam|title=GeoBeagle: an Android app for geocaching and letterboxing|url=https://code.google.com/p/geobeagle/|work=Google codes projects|publisher=Google Project Hosting|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow them to use their 3G and GPS-enabled devices to actively search for and download new caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bardua|first=Joachim|title=GeoBeagle – Geocaching Apps für Android Smartphones (5) (GeoBeagle - Geocaching apps for Android smartphones (5))|url=http://www.navigation-professionell.de/geobeagle-geocaching-apps-fur-android-smartphones-5/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=Navigation-Professionell|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cutler|first=Kim-Mai|title=Augmented reality meets scavenger hunt with GeoBeagle, Wikitude|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/08/09/augmented-reality-meets-scavenger-hunt-with-geobeagle-wikitude/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=Venturebeat|date=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Converting and filtering data===
A variety of geocaching applications are available for geocache data management, file-type translation, and personalization. Geocaching [[software]] can assign special icons or search (filter) for caches based on certain criteria (e.g. distance from an assigned point, difficulty, date last found).

[[File:GeoCache and GPSr.jpg|thumb|Coordinates for a geocache can be downloaded onto a GPS receiver and found, without the need for a printout.]]

'''Paperless geocaching''' means hunting a geocache without a physical printout of the cache description. Traditionally, this means that the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by [[Garmin]], [[DeLorme]] and [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]] have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html |title=Outdoor-Navigation mit dem Garmin Colorado 300 |date=April 1, 2008 |publisher=connect.de |page=1 |language=German |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220202659/http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html |archivedate=December 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with an Internet-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.

A more controversial version of paperless caching involves mass-downloading only the coordinates and cache names (or waypoint IDs) for hundreds of caches into older receivers. This is a common practice of some cachers and has been used successfully for years. In many cases, however, the cache description and hint are never read by the seeker before hunting the cache. This means they are unaware of potential restrictions such as limited hunt times, park open/close times, off-limit areas, and suggested parking locations.

===Mobile devices===
The website geocaching.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=${l.c} |url=http://www.geocaching.com/ |title=geocaching.com |publisher=geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; now sells mobile applications which allow users to view caches through a variety of different devices. Currently, the [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPhone]], and [[Windows Phone]] mobile platforms have applications in their respective stores. The apps also allow for a trial version with limited functionality. The site promotes mobile applications, and lists over two dozen applications (both mobile and browser/desktop based) that are using their [[proprietary software|proprietary]] but [[royalty-free]] public API.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/mobile/partners/|title=Geocaching &gt; API Partner Applications|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Developers at c:geo have criticised Groundspeak for being incompatible with open-source development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faq.cgeo.org/#1_21|title=c:geo – FAQ|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-17|work=cgeo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally &quot;c:geo - opensource&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgeo.org |title=cgeo.org |publisher=cgeo.org |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a free opensource full function application for Android phones that is very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lim|first=Ian|title=c:geo Geocaching App for Android Review|url=http://the-gadgeteer.com/2011/11/02/cgeo-geocaching-app-for-android-review/|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=The Gadgeteer|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilián|first=Karel|title=c:geo: vyšla další aktualizace (c: geo: published more updates)|url=http://www.svetandroida.cz/cgeo-vysla-dalsi-aktualizace-201301|accessdate=January 21, 2013|date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schön|first=Otakar|title=Nexus 4 na chvíli v redakci IHNED.cz: Krásný a extrémně rychlý telefon od Googlu Vyzkoušeli jsme novou generaci telefonu Nexus, který pro Google (Nexus 4, while in the newsroom IHNED.cz: Beautiful and extremely fast phone from Google)|url=http://tech.ihned.cz/testy/c1-59059030-prvni-dojmy-nexus-4-video|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=ihned.cz|date=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bardua|first=Joachim|title=c:geo – Geocaching Apps für Android Smartphones (1) (c: geo - geocaching apps for Android smartphones (1))|url=http://www.navigation-professionell.de/cgeo-geocaching-apps-fur-android-smartphones-1/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=Navigation-Professionell|date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This app includes similar features to the official Geocaching mobile application, such as: View caches on a live map ([[Google Maps (app)|Google Maps]] or OpenStreet Maps), navigation using a compass, map, or other applications, logging finds online and offline, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = c:geo – Geocaching for Android|url = http://www.cgeo.org/|website = www.cgeo.org|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
Geocache listing websites have their own guidelines for acceptable geocache publications. Government agencies and others responsible for public use of land often publish guidelines for geocaching, and a &quot;Geocacher's Creed&quot; posted on the Internet asks participants to &quot;avoid causing disruptions or public alarm&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP070927&quot;&gt;Fredrick Kunkle, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/26/AR2007092600843_pf.html Geocaching Craze Pushes Officials To Set Guidelines]'', [[Washington Post]], September 27, 2007. Retrieved March 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10894835 |title=Geocaching puts some authorities on edge |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |agency=Associated Press |date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally accepted rules are to not endanger others, to minimize the impact on nature, to respect [[private property]], and to avoid public alarm.

==Reception==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=August 2015}}
The reception from authorities and the general public outside geocache participants has been mixed to hostile.

Cachers have been approached by [[police]] and questioned when they were seen as acting suspiciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GAGB&amp;nbsp;– Agreements Database |url=http://www.gagb.co.uk/gagb/glad/agreement_view.php?p=40 |work=GAGB Land Agreements Database |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Suspicious Package Not a Bomb | url= http://www.mywesttexas.com/articles/2010/01/08/news/top_stories/pipe_bomb_geochaching_geocache_midland_academy_sports.txt | archive-url= https://archive.today/20120904171554/http://www.mywesttexas.com/articles/2010/01/08/news/top_stories/pipe_bomb_geochaching_geocache_midland_academy_sports.txt | url-status= dead | archive-date= September 4, 2012 | work= MyWestTexas.com | accessdate= January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other times, investigation of a cache location after suspicious activity was reported has resulted in police and bomb squad discovery of the geocache,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corum|first=Molly|title=Geocaching: Awesome Scavenger Hunt, or Bomb Threat Waiting to Happen?|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/geocaching-awesome-scavenger-hunt-or-bomb-threat-waiting-happen-296371|accessdate=January 23, 2013|newspaper=International Business Times|date=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the evacuation of a busy street in [[Wetherby]], [[Yorkshire]], England in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

The placement of geocaches has occasional critics among some government personnel and the public at large who consider it littering.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backpacker.com/skills/navigation/does-geocaching-violate-leave-no-trace/amp/|title=Does Geocaching Violate Leave No Trace? - Backpacker|date=2008-05-07|newspaper=Backpacker|access-date=2016-12-29|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202050402/http://www.backpacker.com/skills/navigation/does-geocaching-violate-leave-no-trace/amp/|archivedate=February 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.100peaks.com/blog/2012/12/22/geocaching-organized-littering|title=Geocaching - Organised Littering?|last=Loranger|first=Derek|date=2012-12-22|website=100 Peaks|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some geocachers act to mitigate this perception by picking up litter while they search for geocaches, a practice referred to in the community as &quot;Cache In Trash Out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Events and caches are often organized revolving around this practice, with many areas seeing significant cleanup that would otherwise not take place, or would instead require federal, state or local funds to accomplish. Geocachers are also encouraged to clean up after themselves by retrieving old containers once a cache has been removed from play.

Geocaching is legal in every country except North Korea (where GPS and all other mobile devices are illegal to possess)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2012/02/geocaching-steps-into-north-korea/|title=Geocaching Steps into North Korea|date=2012-02-17|newspaper=The Geocaching Blog|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually positively received when explained to law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2013/09/advice-to-geocache-hiders-from-law-enforcement/|title=Advice to Geocache Hiders from Law Enforcement|date=2013-09-04|newspaper=The Geocaching Blog|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain types of placements can be problematic. Although generally disallowed, hiders could place caches on private property without adequate permission (intentionally or otherwise), which encourages cache finders to trespass. Caches might also be hidden in places where the act of searching can make a finder look suspicious (e.g. near schools, children's playgrounds, banks, courthouses, or in residential neighborhoods), or where the container placement could be mistaken for a [[drug]] stash or a [[bomb]] (especially in urban settings, under bridges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/06/03/police-search-for-gamer-who-hung-geocache-from-railroad-overpass/|title=Police Search For Gamer Who Hung Geocache From Railroad Overpass|date=June 3, 2011|newspaper=The Naperville Sun and CBS Chicago|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; near banks, courthouses, or embassies). As a result, geocachers are strongly advised to label their geocaches where possible, so that they are not mistaken for a harmful object if discovered by non-geocachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gagb.org.uk/cache-labels.php|title=GAGB Geocache labels|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Geocaching Association of Great Britain|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Geocache.jpg|thumb|A geocache that has been clearly labelled, in order to clarify that the container is harmless in an attempt to reduce alarm if accidentally discovered.]]
As well as concerns about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers hide their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, that may encourage risky behaviour, especially amongst children. Hides in these areas are discouraged,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mike Vogel&quot; /&gt; and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting to search for a cache, and report any problems.

===Laws and legislation===
Regional rules for placement of caches have become quite complex. For example, in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.groundspeak.com/display/GEO/Virginia Groundspeak's Wiki for Virginia's land management policies], retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Wildlife Management Agency now forbids the placement of geocaches on all land controlled by those agencies. Some cities, towns and recreation areas allow geocaches with few or no restrictions, but others require compliance with lengthy permitting procedures.

The [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] passed Bill 3777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess116_2005-2006/bills/3777.htm 2005–2006 Bill 3777: Geocache, geocaching, and letterboxing] South Carolina Legislature Online&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005, stating, &quot;It is unlawful for a person to engage in the activity of geocaching or letterboxing in a cemetery or in an historic or archeological site or property publicly identified by an historical marker without the express written consent of the owner or entity which oversees that cemetery site or property.&quot; The bill was referred to committee on first reading in the Senate and has been there ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecolumbiastar.com/news/2005-05-20/Front_Page/001.html|title=High–tech scavenger hunt Geocachers invade hallowed ground|last=Haynie|first=Rachel|date=May 20, 2005|publisher=Columbia Star|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources requires geocachers who wish to place a geocache at any Illinois state park to submit the location on a USGS 7.5 minute topographical map, the name and contact information of the person(s) wishing to place the geocache, a list of the original items to be included in the geocache, and a picture of the container that is to be placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/recreation/pages/geocaching.aspx|title=Recreation|website=www.dnr.illinois.gov|access-date=2019-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable incidents==

Retrieved 2017-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of a 21-year-old experienced cacher, in December 2011, &quot;while attempting a Groundspeak cache that does not look all that dangerous,&quot; led to discussion in Groundspeak forums of whether changes should be made, and whether cache owners or Groundspeak could be held liable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=287203 After tragic death of experienced geocacher - what needs to change?], retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Groundspeak have since updated their geocaching.com Terms of Use Agreement which specifies that geocachers find geocaches at their own risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/account/documents/termsofuse|title=TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT 2A.

In 2008, two lost hikers on [[Mount Hood]], [[Oregon]], United States, after spending the night in a snow cave, stumbled across a geocache and were able to phone this information out to rescuers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/outdoor/geocaching-save/ |title=Geocaching saves the day for lost hikers &quot; Garmin Blog |publisher=[[Garmin]] |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in their timely rescue.

Three adult geocachers, a 24-year-old woman and her parents, were trapped in a cave and rescued by firefighters in Rochester, New York, United States, while searching for an ammo can in 2012. Rochester Fire Department spokesman Lt. Ted Kuppinger said, &quot;It's difficult because you're invested in it you want to find something like that so people will probably try to push themselves more than they should but you need to be prudent about what you're capable of doing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Sean|title=Three Hikers Rescued From Cave Were Geocaching|url=http://www.13wham.com/mostpopular/story/Seth-Green-Drive-Rochester-people-trapped-cave/5Q1BsL-HmkWb7LJJRGJhTw.cspx?p=2|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130219214137/http://www.13wham.com/mostpopular/story/Seth-Green-Drive-Rochester-people-trapped-cave/5Q1BsL-HmkWb7LJJRGJhTw.cspx?p=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013|newspaper=13 ABC WHAM|date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coastguard]] were called to a group of geocachers who were spotted walking into the [[Severn Estuary]] off the coast of [[Clevedon]], England, in search of clues to a multi-cache. Although they felt they were safe and were able to return to land, they were considered to be in danger and were airlifted back to the shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-32380734|title=Rescued Clevedon geocachers were 'never in danger'|date=2015-04-20|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, four people discovered a crashed car at the bottom of a ravine in [[Benton County, Washington|Benton, Washington]], United States, while out geocaching. They spotted the driver still trapped inside, and alerted the emergency services who effected a rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2016/11/geocachers-save-a-womans-life/|title=Geocachers Save A Woman’s Life|date=2016-11-17|newspaper=The Geocaching Blog|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2018 four people in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], were surprised by a strong sudden storm while searching for a cache in 4&amp;nbsp;km long tunnel. They were carried by the tidal wave for almost the whole length of the tunnel to the Vltava river where the tunnel ends. One woman was found dead in the river a few hours later. Six days later a second body, that of a man in the group, was found in the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kenety |first1=Brian |title=Second body found in Vltava River that of missing geocacher {{!}} Radio Prague |url=https://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/second-body-found-in-vltava-river-that-of-missing-geocacher |website=Radio Praha |accessdate=1 April 2019 |language=en |date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two exhausted drowning people were rescued from the river suffering mostly from numerous bruises and blunt traumas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/povoden-v-prazskem-podzemi-jak-se-ctverice-lidi-sama-dostala-do-smrtelneho-nebezpeci-49004?dop-ab-variant=&amp;seq-no=1&amp;source=hp|title=Povodeň v pražském podzemí: Jak se čtveřice lidí sama dostala do smrtelného nebezpečí - Seznam Zprávy|website=www.seznamzpravy.cz|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/potok-praha-nabrezi-kanaly-patrani-osoba-policie-hasici-geochaching-1py-/domaci.aspx?c=A180609_193521_domaci_pmk|title=Policie obnovila pátrání po lovci pokladů, potvrdila identitu utonulé ženy|date=2018-06-09|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Websites and data ownership==
Numerous websites list geocaches around the world. Geocaching websites vary in many ways, including control of data.

===First page===
The first website to list geocaches was announced by Mike Teague on May 8, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Geocaching---Early-History-295308.html|title=Geocaching - Early History - Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information|access-date=2017-01-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713220930/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Geocaching---Early-History-295308.html|archivedate=July 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2000, Jeremy Irish emailed the gpsstash mailing list that he had registered the domain name geocaching.com and had set up his own Web site. He copied the caches from Mike Teague's database into his own. On September 6, Mike Teague announced that Jeremy Irish was taking over cache listings. {{as of|2012}}, Teague had logged only 5 caches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teague&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awesomegeocaching.com/2012/08/14/interview-mike-teague-on-the-first-geocache-listing-site/|title=Interview: Mike Teague On The First Geocache Listing Site|date=August 14, 2012|work=Awesome Geocaching|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geocaching.com ===
[[File:A message from under the stone on the Hill of Fare - geograph.org.uk - 413840.jpg|thumb|A message from under the stone on the ''[[Blelack|Cauld Hill O' Fare]]'']]

The largest site is Geocaching.com, owned by Groundspeak Inc., which began operating in late 2000. With a worldwide membership and a [[freemium]] business model, the website claims millions of caches and members in over 200 countries. Hides and events are reviewed by volunteer regional cache reviewers before publication. Free membership allows users access to coordinates, descriptions, and logs for some caches; for a fee, users are allowed additional search tools, the ability to download large amounts of cache information onto their gps at once, instant email notifications about new caches, and access to premium-member-only caches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocaching.com/premium/ Geocaching.com's Premium Membership Benefits] Retrieved June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opencaching Network===
[[File:Riverside Cache - not FTF.jpg|thumb|A geocache hidden through the Opencaching website.]]
The Opencaching Network provides independent, non-commercial listing sites based in the cacher's country or region. The Opencaching Network lists the most types of caches, including traditional, virtual, moving, multi, quiz, webcam, BIT, guest book, USB, event and MP3. The Opencaching Network is less restrictive than many sites, and does not charge for the use of the sites, the service being community driven. Some (or all) listings may or may not be required to be reviewed by community volunteers before being published and although cross-listing is permitted, it is discouraged. Some listings are listed on other sites, but there are many that are unique to the Opencaching Network. Features include the ability to organize one's favourite caches, build custom searches, be instantly notified of new caches in one's area, seek and create caches of all types, export GPX queries, statpics, etc. Each Opencaching Node provides the same API for free (called &quot;OKAPI&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/opencaching/okapi |title=Opencaching Network API |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for use by developers who want to create third-party applications able to use the Opencaching Network's content.

Countries with associated opencaching websites include the United States at www.opencaching.us;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE JOYS OF GEOCACHING&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eastcountymagazine.org/joys-geocaching|title=THE JOYS OF GEOCACHING|website=East County Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]] at www.opencaching.de;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gründel|first=Markus|title=Geocaching: Basiswissen für Draussen|publisher=Conrad Stein Verlag, GmbH|isbn=3866862725|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndr.de/ratgeber/reise/Wie-funktioniert-Geocaching,geocaching376.html|title=Geocaching: Wie funktioniert das?|last=NDR|website=www.ndr.de|language=de|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]] at www.opencaching.se; [[Poland]] at www.opencaching.pl;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcformat.pl/Geocaching---co-to-jest-i-na-czym-polega,a,4027|title=Geocaching - co to jest i na czym polega?|website=www.pcformat.pl|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech Republic]] at www.opencaching.cz;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://navigovat.mobilmania.cz/clanky/garmin-spousti-opencaching-porazi-geocaching/sc-265-a-1315117|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://navigovat.mobilmania.cz/clanky/garmin-spousti-opencaching-porazi-geocaching/sc-265-a-1315117|title=Garmin spouští OpenCaching: porazí Geocaching?|last=Kuruc|first=Jiří|website=Navigovat.MobilMania.cz|language=cs|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] at www.opencaching.nl; [[Romania]] at www.opencaching.ro; the [[United Kingdom]] at www.opencache.uk.&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenCaching United States Wiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Main_Page|title=OpenCaching United States Wiki|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opensource.com/life/14/9/geocaching-experience-catching|title=The geocaching experience is catching|last=comments|first=30 Sep 2014 Heiko W. RuppFeed 167up 2|website=Opensource.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between opencaching and traditional listing sites is that all services are open to the users at no cost. Generally, most geocaching services or websites offer some basic information for free, but users may have to pay for premium membership that allows access to more information or advanced searching capabilities. This is not the case with opencaching; every geocache is listed and accessible to everyone for free.&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenCaching United States Wiki&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, Opencaching sites allow users to rate and report on existing geocaches. This allows users to see what other cachers think of the cache and it encourages participants to place higher quality caches. The rating system also greatly reduces the problem of abandoned or unsatisfactory caches still being listed after repeated negative comments or posts in the cache logs.&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenCaching United States Wiki&quot;/&gt;

===OpenCaching.com===
OpenCaching.com (short: OX) was a site created and run by Garmin from 2010-2015, which had the stated aim of being as free and open as possible with no paid content. Caches were approved by a community process and coordinates were available without an account. The service closed on 14 August 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;THE JOYS OF GEOCACHING&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;comments&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/try-a-family-treasure-hunt-for-the-gps-generation-2296334.html|title=Try a family treasure hunt for the GPS generation|date=2011-06-12|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/new-garmin-oregon-handheld-gps-devices/|title=Four new Oregon touchscreen GPS devices pop up on Garmin's website (updated)|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/health/6-of-the-best-walking-gadgets-to-get-you-fitter-35726792.html|title=6 of the best... walking gadgets to get you fitter|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-03-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nola.com/outdoors/2015/01/free_things_to_do_on_the_north_2.html|title=Free things to do on the north shore: Become a treasure hunter with geocaching|last=Martinez|first=Kara|date=2015-01-28|website=nola.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/cape-coral/2015/03/29/scavenger-hunt-hobby-geocaching-gaining-popularity/70572696/|title=Scavenger-hunt hobby geocaching gaining popularity|website=The News-Press|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sites===
In many countries there are regional geocaching sites, but these mostly only compile lists of caches in the area from the three main sites. Many of them also accept unique listings of caches for their site, but these listings tend to be less popular than the international sites, although occasionally the regional sites may have more caches than the international sites. There are some exceptions though, e.g. in the former [[Soviet Union]], the site Geocaching[[.su]] remains popular because it accepts listings in the [[Cyrillic script]]. Additional international sites include Geocaching.de, a German website, and Geocaching Australia, which accepts listings of cache types deprecated by geocaching.com, cache types such as TrigPoint and Moveable caches, as well as traditional geocache types.

====GPSgames====
GPSgames.org is an online community dedicated to all kinds of games involving Global Positioning System receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/content/blogsection/9/59/|title=About GPSgames.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPSgames.org allows traditional geocaches as well as virtual, locationless, and traveler geocaches. Geodashing, Shutterspot, GeoVexilla, MinuteWar, GeoPoker, and GeoGolf are among the GPS games available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/content/section/3/57/|title=GPS Games|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPSgames.org has been 100% free since 2001, through donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/|title=GPSgames.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NaviCache====
Navicache.com started as a regional listing service in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Rebirth Of Navicaching&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notaboutthenumbers.com/2012/06/05/the-rebirth-of-navicaching/|title=The Rebirth Of Navicaching|date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the website's listings have been posted to other sites, it also offers unique listings. The website lists nearly any type of geocache and does not charge to access any of the caches listed in its database. All submissions are reviewed and approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navicache.com/cgi-bin/db/faq.google2.wap.pl|title=Navicache Geocaching FAQ|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navicache is under transition to new owners, who said they &quot;plan to develop a site that geocachers want, with rules that geocachers think are suitable. Geocaching.com and OX are both backed by large enterprises, and while that means they have more funding and people, we’re a much smaller team – so our advantage is the ability to be dynamic and listen to the users.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Rebirth Of Navicaching&quot;/&gt;

====TerraCaching====
Terracaching.com seeks to provide high-quality caches made so by the difficulty of the hide or from the quality of the location. Membership is managed through a sponsorship system, and each cache is under continual peer review from other members. Terracaching.com embraces virtual caches alongside traditional or multi-stage caches and includes many locationless caches among the thousands of caches in its database. It is increasingly attracting members who like the point system. In Europe, TerraCaching is supported by Terracaching.eu. This site is translated in different European languages, has an extended FAQ and extra supporting tools for TerraCaching. TerraCaching strongly discourages caches that are listed on other sites (so-called double-listing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terracaching.com/|title=Welcome to TerraCaching.com|accessdate= January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extremcaching====
Extremcaching is a German private database for alternative geocaches with a focus on T5 / Climbing Caches, Night Caches, Lost Place Caches. For extreme caching all you need is an extreme caching account, a GPS device with coordinates or a GPS-enabled smartphone with geocaching or outdoor navigation software, eg c:geo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://extremcaching.com|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://extremcaching.com/|title=Extremcaching - T5 + Lost Place Geocaching|website=extremcaching.com|language=de-de|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slang ====
Geocahing Slang include: 

* &quot;TFTC&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''&quot;Thanks For The Cache&quot;'''

A message written by the finder as a Thanks&lt;/ref&gt; 
* &quot;PNGs&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''&quot;Park N' Grabs&quot;'''

Simple caches that are placed near a roadside

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  
* &quot;ALR&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''&quot;Additional Logging Requirement&quot;'''

Logging requirements beyond finding the geocache and signing the log&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;BYOP&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''&quot;Bring Your Own Pen&quot;'''
