'''Bereket''', formerly '''Gazandjyk''' or ''Kazandzhik'' ({{lang-ru|'''Казанджик'''}} or {{lang|ru|Газанджык}} gɑˈzɑnd͡ʒik), is a [[List of cities in Turkmenistan|city]] in [[Balkan Province]] in western [[Turkmenistan]]. Bereket is the administrative centre of the [[Bereket District]].

The city is located in an oasis in the foothills of the [[Kopetdag|Kopetdag Mountains]] and on the edge of the [[Karakum Desert]].

Bereket is an important strategic [[Bereket railway station (Turkmenistan)|railway intersection]] of the [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] ([[Caspian Sea]]-[[Turkmenistan]]-[[Uzbekistan]]-[[Kazakhstan]]) and [[North–South Transport Corridor|North-South Transnational Railway]] ([[Russia]]-Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-[[Iran]]-[[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;railway-technology1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/northsouthtransnatio/ |title=North-South Transnational Corridor |publisher=railway-technology.com|date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turkmenistaninfo.ru/?page_id=6&amp;type=article&amp;elem_id=page_6/magazine_114/1011&amp;lang_id=en |title=Crossing of Railways |publisher=turkmenistaninfo.ru|date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a large locomotive repair depot and a modern railway station.

The city is located approximately {{convert|260|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the Turkmen capital of [[Ashgabat]] and {{convert|340|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the [[Caspian Sea]] port of [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]]. The  largest cities nearby are [[Balkanabat]] {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}} to the west, and [[Serdar (city)|Serdar]] {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east.

The estimated population of the city is 24,500 as of March 2015.

== Etymology ==
The exact origin of the name is unknown. ''Gazanjyk'' is probably derived from a [[Turkic language]] word  ''gazan'' or ''kazan'' (meaning a large [[Kazan (cookware)|cooking pot used throughout Central Asia]], roughly equivalent to a [[cauldron]], boiler) and ''-jyk'' a suffix to denote ''small'' in size. The name can be translated into English as ''small kazan'' or ''small cauldron''. 
The present-day name of the city ''Bereket'' in the [[Turkmen language]] means ''abundance'' or ''prosperity''. The word ''Bereket'' is borrowed from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''Barakat'' (برکت) into Turkmen. Persian in turn has borrowed it from Arabic ''Barakah'' (برکة).

== History ==
Since ancient times the area where city is now located was known as an important junction on the famous [[Silk Road]] that connected [[China]] with the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]].

[[Aleksey Kuropatkin]], the [[Imperial Russian Army]] commander of the Turkestan Rifle Brigade, who made an 18-day march in 1880–1881 across {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip}} of Karakum desert writes in his memoirs &quot;the 5th transition to Kazandjik – {{convert|64|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}. A waterless road. The soil is sandy, clayey, alkaline; there are sparse clumps of weeds and even sparser haloxylon  trees four feet in height. This transition separates the Balkan mountains from Kyurendag. Kazandjik wells lie in the gorge of the Kyurendag mountains, along the stream of a small river. Water in the wells is fresh and of good quality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;voslit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/M.Asien/XIX/1880-1900/Kuropatkin/text1.htm |title=Завоевание Туркмении. Поход в Ахал-теке в 1880–1881 гг. (Conquest of Turkmenija. Military campaign in Ahal-teke in 1880–1881. |publisher=vostlit.info|date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conquest of the [[Transcaspian Oblast]] the [[Russian Empire]] started to build the [[Trans-Caspian railway]] including towns and settlements along the route. Kazandjik, as an urban city, was founded in 1895 to serve as an important  junction on the railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;acad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/92111/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BA |title=Большая советская энциклопедия (Large Soviet Encyclopedae) |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916–1942 Kazandjik and the area around the town was the scene of furious battles between Russian Imperial forces, and after 1918 Soviet Red Army, with local nationalist Muslims, during the [[Basmachi movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;max&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxpark.com/community/14/content/2324925 |title=Бои в пустыне. Туркмения. (Battles in the desert.

(Battles for Kazandjik.) |publisher=konftext.ru/|date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Soviet period the 61631th army garrison had been built on the outskirts of the city. In 1988 it had stationed strong army units, the 231th tank regiment, the 160th motorized rifle regiment and the 405th artillery regiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;army&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svaku.ru/forum/archive/index.php/t-755.html |title=Archive forum |publisher=svaku.ru|date= |accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December [[2000 Turkmenistan earthquake]] (7.0 on the moment magnitude scale) devastated the city center.&lt;ref name=&quot;trend&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trend.az/news/politics/1465654.html |title=Президент Туркменистана дал поручение о благоустройстве города Берекет, пострадавшего от землетрясения 2000 года |publisher=trend.az|date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Kopetdag mountains in early spring, a view from Bereket city.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Kopetdag|Kopetdag mountains]] in early spring, a view from Bereket city.]]
See satellite image of Bereket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;cp=qj75msnmt46t&amp;lvl=15&amp;dir=0&amp;sty=b&amp;form=LMLTCC |title=Bing Kaarten – Routebeschrijvingen, verkeer en wegomstandigheden |publisher=Bing.com |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is located on the most western foothills of the [[Kopetdag|Kopetdag mountains]] called [[Kyurendag Ridge|Kyurendag]] on the edge of the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum deserts]]. The maximum height of the Kyurendag ridge is {{convert|968|m|0|abbr=on}}. 
The vegetation of the ridge is quite poor and is represented primarily by species of desert flora, [[sagebrush]], semi-desert and dry [[steppe]] and rocky outcrops. Soils – gray soils. One can occasionally find [[Juniper|juniper trees]], single or large groups of ''tamarisk'' and small shrubs. 
Wildlife in recent years has become greatly impoverished. Ungulates are few in number. ''Argali'' sheep are seen occasionally, as are [[goat|bezoar goats]] and [[boar|wild boars]], [[gazelle]]s. Predators include[[wolves]], [[jackals]], [[foxes]], [[hyenas]]. Among birds klik are rarely seen and stone curlews and jacks very rarely. Reptile species are represented by the steppe tortoise, monitor lizard, boa, agam, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;restinwold&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://restinworld.ru/stories/turkmenistan/41079/1.html |title=Кюрендаг – горный хребет Туркменистана (Kyurendag – a mountain ridge in Turkmenistan) |publisher=restinworld.ru/|date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
