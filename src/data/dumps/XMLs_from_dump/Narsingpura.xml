'''Narsingpura''' is one of the Jain communities. It originated from the [[Mewar]] ([[Rajasthan]]) region. Many of them have migrated to Gujarat, MP, and recently to Maharashtra.

Narsingpura community follows Digambar Jain sect. According to tradition, it was founded by  Acharya Ramasena who belonged to [[Kashtha Sangh]] order, at a town called Narsingpura Patan of Mewad, now Lunada in Dist Udaipur.&lt;ref&gt;People of India By Kumar Suresh Singh, Anthropological Survey of India, B. V. Bhanu Published 2004 Popular Prakashan, pages 1538- {{ISBN|81-7991-102-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last [[Bhattaraka]] of the [[Kashtha Sangh]] Naditat Gaccha at Pratapgarh was Bhattarak Yashkirtijee Maharaj ordained in Samvat 1974. His disciples Pandit Raamchandraji and Daadamchandji have compiled the historical account of the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://ndjains.org/ History of the Birth of Shree Narsingpura Community&lt;/ref&gt; They follow the [[Bispanth]] traditions.
