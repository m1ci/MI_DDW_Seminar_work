'''Jenin''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|'|n|iː|n}}; {{lang-ar|{{Audio|ArJenin.ogg|جنين}}}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ǧinīn}}'') is a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] city in the northern [[West Bank]]. It serves as the administrative center of the [[Jenin Governorate]] and is a major center for the surrounding towns.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 2007 the city had a population of 39,004.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCBS Jenin&quot;&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book1487.pdf 2007 Locality Population Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210081942/http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book1487.pdf |date=2010-12-10 }}.

==Etymology==
Jenin was known in ancient times as the village of &quot;Ein-Jenin&quot; or &quot;Tel Jenin&quot;.&lt;ref name=Shahinp183&gt;{{cite book|title=Palestine:A Guide|author=Mariam Shahin|publisher=Interlink Books|year=2005|isbn=1-56656-557-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/palestine00mari/page/183 183]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/palestine00mari/page/183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tell Jenin, is located at the center of what is today Jenin's business district.&lt;ref name=Kohlp339&gt;Kohl et al., 2007, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Bronze Age===
{{further|Gina (Canaan)}}
Jenin has been identified as the place &quot;[[Gina (Canaan)|Gina]]&quot; mentioned in the [[Amarna letters]] from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 103 | author = Shmuel Aḥituv | title = Canaanite Toponyms in Ancient Egyptian Documents | publisher = The Magnes Press | year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Gina managed to kill the notorious warlord [[Labaya]] during the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]].{{sfnp|Dodson|2016|p=81}}

===Iron Age===
Four [[terracotta]] lamps of [[Phoenicia]]n origin dated to the 8th century BCE were discovered in Ain Jenin by archaeologist G. I. Harding, and are interpreted as attesting to some form of contact and exchange between the residents of Jenin at that time and those of [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref name=Hadidip92&gt;Hadidi, 1995, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
During the Roman period, Jenin was called &quot;Ginae&quot; and was settled exclusively by Samaritans (Heb. כותים). The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities'' (Book xx, chapter vi, verse 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical commentator [[F. W. Farrar]] raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, &quot;the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to [[Judea]] over [[Mount Tabor]]] would arrive&quot;, was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in [[Luke's Gospel]] at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, F. W., [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/9.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Luke 9, accessed 11 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine period===
Ceramics dating from the [[Byzantine Empire |Byzantine]] era have been found here.&lt;ref&gt;Dauphin, 1998, p. 750&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mamluk period===
[[Dimashki]], writing around  year 1300, said that after the rise of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|&quot;Turk power&quot;]], the empire was divided into nine (sub-)kingdoms&quot;, or ''Mamlakat''. Jenin was listed as one of the places belonging to the  (sub-)kingdom centred at [[Safad]].&lt;ref&gt;Cited in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/41/mode/1up 41]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]] described Jenin as &quot;a small and beautiful town, lying between [[Nabulus]] and [[Baisan]], in the Jordan Province. There is much water, and many springs are found here, and often have I visited it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/464/mode/1up 464]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 13th century, [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] [[emir]]s stationed at Jenin were ordered by [[Qalawun]], the [[sultan]], &quot;to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of '[[Acre, Israel|Akka]], so as to protect the coast and the merchants.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ayalonp168&gt;Ayalon and Sharon, 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PehCQz9Rt8oC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=jenin+mamluk&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=jenin%20mamluk&amp;f=false p. 168].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
[[File:Jenin by David Roberts, 1839.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of Jenin by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], 1839, in ''[[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]'']]
[[File:Jenin bazaar scene, 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Street scene in Jenin, 1917. An Ottoman Army soldier (center left) with a local resident (center right)]]

During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Palestine]] (1517-1918), Jenin, [[Lajjun]] and the Carmel area, were for part of the 17th century ruled by the [[Bedouin]] Turabay family.&lt;ref name=Chattyp868&gt;Chatty, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JzqIpRZAvdEC&amp;pg=PA868  p. 868].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[daftar|census]] of 1596,  Jenin was located  in the ''[[nahiya]]'' of Jenin, in the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]'' of [[Lajjun]]. It had a population of 8 households, all [[Muslim]].  They paid a  fixed tax rate of 25 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to  occasional revenues; a total of  2,000 [[akçe]]. All of the revenue went to a [[Waqf]] in the name of [[Sultan]] ''Guri''.&lt;ref name=HA160/&gt;

In the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and [[Ajlun]].&lt;ref name=Doumanip39&gt;Doumani, 1995, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt]] which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Quataertp107&gt;Quataert, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OX3lsOrXJGcC&amp;pg=PA107  p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, some members of the [[Jarrar clan|Jarrar family]], who formed part of the ''mallakin'' (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in [[Haifa]] to set up an export enterprise there.&lt;ref name=Yazbakp150&gt;Yazbak, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DPseCvbPsKsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA150&amp;dq=jenin+ottoman&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=jenin%20ottoman&amp;f=false p. 150].&lt;/ref&gt; During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://birzeit.academia.edu/Hamedsalem/Papers/1202529/The_Archaeology_of_Warfare_Local_Chiefdoms_and_Settlement_Systems_in_the_Jenin_Region_during_the_Ottoman_Period_of_Palestine|title=The Archaeology of Warfare: Local Chiefdoms and Settlement Systems in the Jenin Region during the Ottoman Period of Palestine|author=Hamed Salem|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French explorer [[Victor Guérin|Guérin]] visited in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1874, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptionsam01gu#page/327/mode/1up 327] - [https://archive.org/stream/descriptionsam01gu#page/332/mode/1up 332]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1882, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' described  Jenin as &quot;The capital of the district, the seat of a [[Caimacam]],  a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by 'And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century  [..], north of the town is the little mosque of 'Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II,  pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp02conduoft#page/44/mode/1up 44] -45&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate period===
[[File:British bombing of Jenin, 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings in Jenin dynamited by British forces, 1938]]

According to a [[1922 census of Palestine|census]] conducted in 1922 by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate authorities]], Jenin had a population of 2,637, consisting of 2,307 Muslims, 7 Jews, 108 Christians, 212 Hindus and 3 Sikhs.&lt;ref name=census1922/&gt; From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory]] authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on &quot;an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage&quot; that caused the British administration &quot;grave concern,&quot; according to a British report to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/gordon-corera/british-jenin|title=The British in Jenin|first=Gordon  |last=Corera |authorlink=Gordon Corera|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city played an important role in the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], prompted by the death of [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of [[Ya'bad]] months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. After ordering the inhabitants to leave, about one quarter of the town was blown up.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The British in Jenin&quot;, ''History Today'', July 2002, [[Gordon Corera]], pp. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenin was used by [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]]'s [[Arab Liberation Army]] as a base.

===1948 War===
{{further|Battle of Jenin (1948)}}
In the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the city was defended by the [[Iraqi Army]], then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's [[Carmeli Brigade]] during the &quot;Ten Days' fighting&quot; following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber|Gelber, Yoav]] (2004) &quot;''Independence Versus Nakba''&quot;; [[Kinneret Zmora-Bitan Dvir]] Publishing, {{ISBN|965-517-190-6}}, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|Siege of Jerusalem]], and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.

===Jordanian control===
The Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian control]]. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.

The [[Jordan]]ian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.&lt;ref name=Jordan1961/&gt;

===Contemporary period===
{{further|Battle of Jenin}}
[[File:West Bank-13.jpg|thumb|right|A street in Jenin, 2011]]
Jenin has been under [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli occupation]] since the [[Six-Day War]], in 1967. 

In 1996, [[Israel]] handed over control of the city to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in keeping with the [[Oslo Accords]]. Known to Palestinians as &quot;the [[Martyr (shahid)|martyrs]]' capital&quot;, the camp's militants, some 200 armed men, included members of [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades]], [[Tanzim]], [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] (PIJ) and [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCmartyrs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernanp434&gt;{{cite book|title=United Nations Yearbook 2002|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yp2sSGFOXAgC&amp;pg=PA434&amp;dq=cufew+jenin+2002&amp;q=curfew%20Jenin%202002|publisher=Bernan Press|year=2002|accessdate=September 9, 2009 | isbn=978-92-1-100904-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Israel's count, at least 28 [[Suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000–2003 during the [[Second Intifada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCmartyrs&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lee| first = Ken| title = Jenin rises from the dirt| work = BBC| accessdate = September 21, 2008| date = June 24, 2003| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3015814.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli army weekly ''[[Bamahane]]'' attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Bamahane]]|issue= 3003|pages=31–32|title=BeGeder Hatzlaha (Hebrew title)|author1=Kiron, Omri |author2=Al-Peleg, Daniel |date=September 4, 2009|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], Israel launched [[Operation Defensive Shield]] with the stated aim of dismantling terrorist infrastructure so as to curb [[suicide bombings]] and other militant activities. The army encircled and entered six major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, among them Jenin. During the [[Battle of Jenin]] in April 2002, 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, including civilians&lt;ref name=AFPJTimesJul2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Krauss|first=Joseph|title=Weary West Bank fighters watch Gaza assault from afar|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=13544|publisher=AFP / The Jordan Times}} - &quot;Fifty-four Palestinians and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the mêlée.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPostJul2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title=IDF mulls entry to West Bank cities by Jewish Israelis|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=181364|newspaper=JPost|date=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Needs an Israeli response to the massacre allegations here as well as a note to the mixed 'still massacre'/'great victory' Palestinian perspectives --&gt;

Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, as a result died. Human Rights Watch have regarded many killings to be unlawful such as the death of a 57-year-old wheelchair bound man who was shot and run over by a tank despite having attached a white flag on his wheelchair. A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was refused to be allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/israel3/israel0502-05.htm#P234_38516  CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND UNLAWFUL KILLINGS IN JENIN], HRW&lt;/ref&gt;  There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son's shoulder as he shot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/israel3/israel0502-01.htm#P49_1774 SUMMARY], HRW&lt;/ref&gt; Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew. Over the following years, Jenin was subject to extended [[curfew]]s and [[targeted killing]]s.

During a gun-battle with [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an [[Israel]]i military [[sniper]] shot and killed a [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UN Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) employee, [[Iain Hook]] (54) on November 22, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2507105.stm Israel admits killing British UN worker] ''[[BBC News]]'' November 23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The sniper reportedly mistook a cellphone in Hook's hands for a gun or grenade.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Ian |title=Israel admits one of its soldiers killed U.N. officer in Jenin |journal=[[New York Times]] |issue=November 24 |quote=An Israeli soldier then fired at Mr. Hook inside the compound when he saw ''&quot;an object which resembles a pistol&quot; in his hand, the statement read.''|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E1D61039F937A15752C1A9649C8B63&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=%22Iain%20Hook%22&amp;st=cse |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |date=2002-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
