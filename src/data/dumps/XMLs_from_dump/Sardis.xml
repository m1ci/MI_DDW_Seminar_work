'''Sardis''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|s|…ër|d|…™|s}}) or '''Sardes''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|s|…ër|d|iÀê|z}}; [[Lydian language|Lydian]]: ê§Æê§±ê§†ê§≠ê§£ ''Sfard''; {{lang-grc|Œ£Œ¨œÅŒ¥ŒµŒπœÇ}} ''Sardeis''; {{lang-peo|Sparda}}; {{lang-hbo|◊°◊§◊®◊ì}} ''Sfarad'') was an ancient city at the location of modern ''Sart'' (Sartmahmut before 19 October 2005), near the [[Salihli]] in [[Turkey]]'s [[Manisa Province]]. Sardis was the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Lydia]],&lt;ref name=rhodes&gt;Rhodes, P.J. ''A History of the Classical Greek World 478-323&amp;nbsp;BC''. 2nd edition. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the important cities of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the seat of a [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] Satrap, the seat of a [[proconsul]] under the [[Roman Empire]], and the metropolis of the province Lydia in later Roman and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times. As one of the [[seven churches of Asia]], it was addressed by [[John of Patmos|John]], the author of the [[Book of Revelation]] in the [[New Testament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|3:1-6|NLJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms which seem to imply that its church members did not finish what they started, that they were about image and not substance&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||revelation|3:2|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its importance was due first to its military strength, secondly to its situation on an important highway leading from the interior to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast, and thirdly to its commanding the wide and fertile plain of the [[Gediz River|Hermus]].

==Geography==
Sardis was situated in the middle of [[Gediz River|Hermus]] valley, at the foot of [[Mount Tmolus]], a steep and lofty spur which formed the citadel. It was about {{convert|4|km|mi|1}} south of the Hermus. Today, the site is located by the present day village of ''Sart'', near [[Salihli]] in the Manisa province of Turkey, close to the [[Ankara]] - [[ƒ∞zmir]] highway (approximately {{convert|72|km|mi|0}} from [[ƒ∞zmir]]). The part of remains including the bath-gymnasium complex, synagogue and Byzantine shops is open to visitors year-round.

==History==

[[File:Lydia circa 50 AD - English legend.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sardis in the middle of Lydia, {{circa|50 AD}}]]

===Foundation stories===
The Greek historian and father of history, Herodotus, notes that the city was founded by the sons of Hercules, the [[Heracleidae|Heraclides]]. According to Herodotus, the Heraclides ruled for five hundred and five years beginning with [[Agron of Lydia|Agron]], 1220 BC, and ending with [[Candaules]], 716 BC. They were followed by the Mermnades, which began with [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], 716 BC, and ended with [[Croesus]], 546 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cockayne, O.|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3917311;view=1up;seq=306|title=On the Lydian Dynasty which preceded the Mermnad√¶|year=1844|journal=Proceedings of the Philological Society|volume=1|number=24|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to Sardis is in ''[[The Persians]]'' of [[Aeschylus]] (472&amp;nbsp;BC); in the ''[[Iliad]]'', the name ‚ÄúHyde‚Äù seems to be given to the city of the [[Maeonian]] (i.e. [[Lydians|Lydian]]) chiefs and in later times Hyde was said to be the older name of Sardis, or the name of its [[citadel]]. 

It is, however, more probable that Sardis was not the original capital of the Maeonians, but that it became so amid the changes which produced the powerful [[Lydian empire]] of the 8th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.

===Target of conquest===
The city was captured by the [[Cimmerians]] in the 7th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC, by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the 6th, by the [[Athens|Athenians]] in the 5th, and by [[Antiochus III the Great]] at the end of the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.

In the Persian era, Sardis was conquered by [[Cyrus the Great]] and formed the end station for the Persian [[Royal Road]] which began in [[Persepolis]], capital of [[Persia]]. Sardis was the site of the most important Persian satrapy.{{sfn|Raditsa|1983|page=105}}

During the [[Ionian Revolt]], the [[Athenians]] burnt down the city. Sardis remained under Persian domination until it surrendered to [[Alexander the Great]] in 334&amp;nbsp;BC.

===Reliable gold coins===
The early Lydian kingdom was very advanced in the industrial arts and Sardis was the chief seat of its manufactures. The most important of these trades was the manufacture and dyeing of delicate woolen stuffs and carpets. The stream [[Pactolus]] which flowed through the market-place &quot;carried golden sands&quot; in early antiquity, which was in reality [[Gold|gold dust]] out of [[Mount Tmolus]]. It was during the reign of King [[Croesus]] that the [[metallurgist]]s of Sardis discovered the secret of separating [[gold]] from [[silver]], thereby producing both metals of a purity never known before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=A. |last1=Ramage |first2=P. |last2=Craddock |article=King Croesus' Gold: Excavations at Sardis and the history of gold refining |title=Archaeological Exploration of Sardis |year=2001}}{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an economic revolution, for while gold nuggets panned or mined were used as currency, their purity was always suspect and a hindrance to trade. Such nuggets or coinage were naturally occurring alloys of gold and silver known as [[electrum]] and one could never know how much of it was gold and how much was silver. Sardis now could mint nearly pure silver and gold coins, the value of which could be ‚Äì and was ‚Äì trusted throughout the known world. This revolution made Sardis rich and [[Croesus]]' name synonymous with wealth itself. For this reason, Sardis is famed in history as the place where modern [[currency]] was invented.

===Desolation in 17&amp;nbsp;AD earthquake===
Disaster came to the great city under the reign of the emperor [[Tiberius]], when in [[AD 17 Lydia earthquake|17&amp;nbsp;AD, Sardis was destroyed by an earthquake]], but it was rebuilt with the help of ten&amp;nbsp;million [[Sestertius|sesterces]] from the Emperor and exempted from paying taxes for five&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#47|2.47]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the great cities of western [[Asia Minor]] until the later [[Byzantine]] period.
[[File:SardisByzantineShops1February2003.JPG|thumb|Remains of the Greek [[Byzantine]] shops in Sardis]]

Later, trade and the organization of commerce continued to be sources of great wealth. After [[Constantinople]] became the capital of the East, a new road system grew up connecting the provinces with the capital. Sardis then lay rather apart from the great lines of communication and lost some of its importance. It still, however, retained its titular supremacy and continued to be the seat of the [[See of Sardis|metropolitan bishop]] of the province of Lydia, formed in 295&amp;nbsp;AD. It was enumerated as third, after [[Ephesus]] and [[Smyrna]], in the list of cities of the Thracesion [[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]] given by [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] in the 10th&amp;nbsp;century. However, over the next four centuries it was in the shadow of the provinces of Magnesia-upon-Sipylum and Philadelphia, which retained their importance in the region.

===Decline and fall in the second millennium, AD===
After 1071, the Hermus valley began to suffer from the inroads of the [[Seljuk Turks]] but the Byzantine general [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]] reconquered the city in 1097. The successes of the general Philokales in 1118 relieved the district from later Turkish pressure and the ability of the [[Comnenus|Comneni]] dynasty together with the gradual decay of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] meant that it remained under Byzantine dominion. When [[Sack of Constantinople|Constantinople was taken]] by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Franks]] in 1204 Sardis came under the rule of the Byzantine [[Empire of Nicea]].

However once the Byzantines retook Constantinople in 1261, Sardis with the entire [[Asia Minor]] was neglected and the region eventually fell under the control of Ghazi ([[Ghazw]]) emirs. The [[Cayster river|Cayster]] valleys and a fort on the citadel of Sardis was handed over to them by treaty in 1306. The city continued its decline until its capture (and probable destruction) by the [[Turco-Mongol]] warlord [[Timur]] in 1402.

==Archaeological expeditions==
{{see|Byzantine churches at Sardis}}
[[File:Temple of Artemis Sardis Turkey4.jpg|thumb|The Greek Temple of Artemis at Sardis]]
Current laws governing archaeological expeditions in Turkey ensure that all artifacts remain in Turkey. Some of the important finds from the site of Sardis are housed in the [[Archaeological Museum of Manisa]], including Late Roman mosaics and sculpture, a helmet from the mid-6th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE, and pottery from various periods.

===Roman antiquities===
By the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, Sardis was in ruins, showing construction chiefly of the Roman period. Early excavators included the British explorer [[George Dennis (explorer)|George Dennis]], who uncovered an enormous marble head of [[Faustina the Elder]], wife of the Roman Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]]. Found in the precinct of the Temple of [[Artemis]], it probably formed part of a pair of colossal statues devoted to the Imperial couple. The 1.76&amp;nbsp;metre high head is now kept at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=459896&amp;partId=1&amp;place=34488&amp;plaA=34488-3-1&amp;page=1 |publisher=British Museum |title=Research collection online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large-scale archaeological expedition in Sardis was directed by a [[Princeton University]] team led by [[Howard Crosby Butler]] between years 1910‚Äì1914, unearthing a temple to [[Artemis]], and more than a thousand Lydian tombs. The excavation campaign was halted by [[World War I]], followed by the [[Turkish War of Independence]], though it briefly resumed in 1922. Some surviving artifacts from the Butler excavation were added to the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].

===Sardis synagogue===
{{Main|Sardis Synagogue}}
The Hebrew place-name ''[[Sepharad]]'' may have meant Sardis.

[[File:Sardis Synagogue, late 3rd century AD, Sardis, Lydia, Turkey (19331773400).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Sardis Synagogue]]]]
A new expedition known as the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis was founded in 1958 by [[G.M.A. Hanfmann]], professor in the Department of Fine Arts at [[Harvard University]], and by Henry Detweiler, dean of the [[Architecture School at Cornell University]]. Hanfmann excavated widely in the city and the region, excavating and restoring the major Roman bath-gymnasium complex, the synagogue, late Roman houses and shops, a Lydian industrial area for processing [[electrum]] into pure gold and silver, Lydian occupation areas, and tumulus tombs at Bin Tepe.&lt;ref&gt;Hanfmann, George M.A., Et al. 1983. ''Sardis from Prehistoric to Roman Times: Results of the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis 1958‚Äì1975'', Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1976 until 2007, the excavation was directed by [[Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr.]], professor in the Department of Classics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Nicholas D., ed. 2008. &quot;Love for Lydia. A Sardis Anniversary Volume Presented to Crawford H. Greenewalt, jr.&quot;, Archaeological Exploration of Sardis.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, the excavation has been under the directorship of Nicholas Cahill, professor at the [[University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/study-research/research-centers/sardis |title=Archaeological Exploration of Sardis, Harvard Art Museums |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1958, both [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell Universities]] have sponsored annual archeological expeditions to Sardis. These excavations unearthed perhaps the most impressive synagogue in the western diaspora yet discovered from antiquity, yielding over eighty Greek and seven Hebrew inscriptions as well as numerous mosaic floors. (For evidence in the east, see [[Dura-Europos synagogue|Dura Europos]] in [[Syria]].) The discovery of the Sardis synagogue has reversed previous assumptions about Judaism in the later Roman empire. Along with the discovery of the [[God-fearer|godfearers]] / theosebeis inscription from [[Aphrodisias]], it provides indisputable evidence for the continued presence of Jewish communities in Asia Minor and their integration into general Roman life at a time when many scholars previously assumed that Christianity had eclipsed Judaism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The synagogue was a section of a large bath-gymnasium complex, that was in use for about 450‚Äì500&amp;nbsp;years. In the late 4th or 5th century, part of the bath-gymnasium complex was changed into a synagogue.
