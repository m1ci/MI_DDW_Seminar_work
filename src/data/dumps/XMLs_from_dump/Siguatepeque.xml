'''Siguatepeque''' is a growing city in the Central Mountains of [[Honduras]], [[Central America]] at 1100 meters above sea level and surrounded by mountains.

Located almost exactly halfway between Honduras' two largest cities of [[San Pedro Sula]] and [[Tegucigalpa]], it is a major stopping point for rest and refreshment for Honduran and international inter-city traffic.

The town is at the center of a regional vegetable and fruit production area, ensuring a year-round supply of fresh cheap produce.

==Climate==
The climate is mild. There are three seasons. During the wet and fairly cool season between May and November, enough rain falls in the area to ensure luxurious vegetation, while it escapes the excessive humidity of the far hotter and wetter lowland areas. A cooler interlude (November to February) provides seasonal contrast, with temperatures occasionally down to 8째C (40째F) as cold fronts enter from the north. This is followed by a dry season (February to May), with temperatures achieving a pleasantly warm peak of 32째C (95째F). Cool winds flow down from the local Calanterique forest and from the immense Cordillera Montecillos, a Biological Reserve on the southern edge of the valley. Even in the hot season air conditioning is unnecessary, with a fan almost always being enough. In the winter heating is rarely needed.

==History==

Founded by the Spanish in 1689 as a religious centre for retreats and [[monastic]] training, the population of the town grew through the intermarriage of colonists, the indigenous [[Lenca people|Lencas]] and the Mexican [[Nahuatl]] immigrants. The name Siguatepeque is made up of two words in [[Nahuatl]], ''Cihuatl'': Woman and ''Tepec'':Mount,  ''the mount of women''. Siguatepeque is located more than 1,000 metres above the sea level.

In 1861 the town became a municipality in its own right, and a city in 1926.
