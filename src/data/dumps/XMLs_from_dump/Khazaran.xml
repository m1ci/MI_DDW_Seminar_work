'''Khazaran''' was a city in the [[Khazaria|Khazar kingdom]], located on the eastern bank of the lower [[Volga River]]. It was connected to [[Atil, Khazaria|Atil]] by a [[pontoon bridge]].

Khazaran was later inhabited primarily by [[Muslims]] and featured numerous [[mosque]]s, minarets, and madrasas. It was a bustling trade center easily reachable by ship from the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Volga|Volga River]], and many of its inhabitants were crafters, fishers, and traders. The leader of the city was a Muslim official known as the [[Khazz]]; in Arab sources the title given is sometimes [[vizier]].
