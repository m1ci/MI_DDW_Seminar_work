'''Thoise''' is a military airfield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldaerodata.com/wad.cgi?id=IN73136| title=World Aeroport Data|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small village in [[Nubra Valley]], [[Ladakh]], [[India]], occupying the only large piece of flat land in the area. The airstrip is a critical facility enabling a quick inflow of men and material from the Indian interior to [[Siachen]], a glacier, helipad and battleground near the [[Actual Ground Position Line]] between India and [[Pakistan]].

THOISE is not a real name but an acronym: '''T'''ransit '''H'''alt '''O'''f '''I'''ndian '''S'''oldiers '''E'''nroute (to Siachen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/specials/2055_siachen/page5.shtml| title=BBC Hindi Service News}} {{in lang|hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thoise is about an hour and 20 minutes' flight from Delhi. Air India has limited flight operations from &quot;Thoise&quot; to Delhi (Flight AI 3832). 

The place is approximately 16 km away from the village of Hundar and 25 km from [[Diskit]]. It is about 160 km from [[Leh]], the capital of [[Ladakh]]. Thoise is reached via the [[Khardung La]] mountain pass, one of the world's highest roads used by motor vehicles.

Thoise is out of bounds for civilians. The last checkpost is at Hundar, at a bridge where photography is not permitted. [[Indian Oil Corporation Limited]] is building an oil depot to serve the [[Indian Army]]. The construction project is in progress and is monitored from [[Chandigarh]].
