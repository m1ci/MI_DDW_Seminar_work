It is part of  [[Delhiâ€“Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project]] (DMIC) on [[Western Dedicated Freight Corridor]] (WDFC) and also located in the influence zone of the [[Amritsar Delhi Kolkata Industrial Corridor]] (ADKIC) on [[Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor]] (EDFC). It also synergises with other IMT of Haryana along [[Delhi Western Peripheral Expressway]] such as [[Bahadurgarh#IMTB|IMT Bahadurgarh]], [[Kundli#IMTK|IMT Kundli, Sonipat]] and [[Manesar#Industrial_Model_Township_.28IMT.29.2C_Manesar|IMT Manesar]].&lt;ref name=imlhnc2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dubai-based-company-keen-on-investing-in-state/508723.html|title=Dubai-based company keen on investing in state|website=tribuneindia.com|date= 6 December 2017|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During last three years, HSIIDC has allotted 78 Industrial plots in Bawal for medium- and large-scale projects with capital investment of around US$1.18 billion (2016).

===DMIC===
The [[Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project]] (DMIC) is a US$100 billion India-Japan state-sponsored industrial development project of the [[Government of India]] on the [[Western Dedicated Freight Corridor]] (WDFC), aimed at developing 7 Investment Regions of 250 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 13 industrial areas across six states ([[Delhi]], Western [[Uttar Pradesh]], Southern [[Haryana]], Eastern [[Rajasthan]], Eastern [[Gujarat]], Western [[Maharashtra]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]]) in India by boosting major expansion of Infrastructure and Industry, including industrial clusters and [[Rail transport|rail]], road, [[port]] and air connectivity in the states along the route of the Corridor. This would open a floodgate of opportunities along several parts of [[Golden Quadrilateral]] such as [[National Highway 48 (India)|Delhi-Mumbai NH-48]], NH-2, NH-1 and NH -10 for developing industrial, urban and supporting infrastructure through public-private initiatives. More than 60% area of Haryana is under DMIC project, which is extended up to 150&amp;nbsp;km on both sides of the alignment of DMIC. 

[[Manesar#IMT Manesar|Manesar]]-[[Bawal#IMT Bawal|Bawal]]-[[Nangal Chaudhary#IMT Nangal Chaudhary|Nangal Chaudhary]] is one of the investment regions selected for development in the first phase of ambitious DMIC. 
* [[Manesar#IMT Manesar|Manesar]] has more than US$10 billion investment in several large multinational industries, specially from Japan, such as [[Maruti Suzuki]] and [[Tosiba]] Eco City. [[Aadhar]]'s national [[Data Center]] is also located here. 
* [[Bawal#IMT Bawal|Bawal]] has been evolved as a mega industrial growth hub where HSIIDC has allotted 78 Industrial manufacturing plots to 78 medium- and large-scale projects multi-national companies here with capital investment of around US$1.18 billion (2016), including [[Harley-Davidson]], [[Asahi Breweries|Asahi India]], [[Miyamoto Musashi|Musashi Auto Parts India]], [[POSCO|POSCO steel]], [[Kansai Nerolac Paints]], [[YKK]], [[HEMA (store)|Euothern Hema]], [[Keihin Corporation]], [[Atlas Copco]], Ahresty Wilmington Corporation, Caparo Maruti and Haco Group along with many Indian companies such as [[Omax Corporation]], Rico Auto Corporation, Minda Auto Group, Rubyco Modular Furniture International, Tenneco Automotive India, Continental Equipment and Multicolor Steels, Caparo power plant, etc. have set up plants.
