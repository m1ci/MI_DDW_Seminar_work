'''Herning''' ({{IPA-da|ˈhæɐ̯neŋ}}) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] city in [[Region Midtjylland]], on the Jutland peninsula. It is the main town and the administrative seat of [[Herning Municipality]]. Herning has a population of 50,039 (1 January 2019)&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the suburbs of Tjørring, Snejbjerg, Lind, Birk, Hammerum and Gjellerup, making Herning the 11th most populous [[urban area]] in Denmark.

==History==
Herning was established at the beginning of the 1790s, during the period of heath reclamation, as a commercial centre providing goods and services to the farmers in the area. A textile industry later developed in and around the town. This industry was once Herning's principal economic activity. Today, the town has a more diversified industrial base. Herning became a market town in 1913. Herning has twice been awarded the title of Danish City of the Year.

==Industry==
There are many small furniture and textile businesses in and around Herning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyke1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Pyke|title=Industrial Development Through Small-firm Cooperation: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZ1EjXSg8VsC&amp;pg=PR6|year=1992|publisher=International Labour Organization|isbn=978-92-2-108256-9|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herning is home to [[Messecenter Herning]], the largest exhibition centre in [[Scandinavia]], which hosts many trade fairs.

[[Carl-Henning Pedersen]] and [[Else Alfelt|Else Alfelt's]] Museum of Art (also known as Herning Art Museum) is located in the city.

The city is the site of three buildings designed by the architect [[Jørn Utzon]]. One is publicly owned and two are privately owned.

The town is also home to sculptor [[Ingvar Cronhammar]]'s monumental work [[Elia (sculpture)|Elia]]. The sculpture is located near the Herning Art Museum.

The old Herningsholm Estate in Herning is open to the public for touring. Classensborg Estate, now called Skarrildhus, is located 25&amp;nbsp;km south of the town, but is closed to the public because it is a private hotel and educational facility. The grounds, however, can be toured and are known for their beautiful rhododendron displays during the spring.

The Herning Museum displays a history of Herning, as well as the development of moorland agriculture and ancient textile production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sologstrand.com/holiday-denmark/museums/herning-museum.htm &quot;Herning Museum&quot;], ''Sol Og Strand'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro-t-guide.com/See_Coun/Denmark/Jut-M/DK_See_Herning_Museum_1-1.htm &quot;Denmark – Herning Museum&quot;]. ''European Tourist Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum operates traveling educational exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Danish Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ub4SAQAAMAAJ|year=1971|publisher=Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bjarne Riis]], {{asof|2011|lc=yes}} the only Dane to win the [[Tour de France]], was born in Herning. Fourteen years after his win, Riis admitted using illegal performance-enhancing drugs for the competition; however, he retained the Trikot since the statute of limitations had already expired prior to his admission.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The final of the [[2019 World Men's Handball Championship]] will be played in [[Jyske Bank Boxen]].
