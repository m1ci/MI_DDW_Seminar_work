'''NanoArt''' is a novel [[art]] discipline related to [[science]] and [[technology]]. It depicts natural or synthetic structures with features sized at the [[nanometer]] scale, which are observed by [[electron microscopy|electron]] or [[scanning probe microscopy]] techniques in scientific laboratories. The recorded two or three dimensional images and movies are processed for artistic appeal and presented to the general audience.

One of the aims of NanoArt is to familiarize people with [[nanoscale]] objects and advances in their synthesis and manipulation. NanoArt has been presented at traditional art exhibitions around the world. Besides, online competitions have been launched in the 2000s such as the “NANO” 2003 show at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and “Nanomandala”, the 2004 and 2005 installations in New York and Rome by [[Victoria Vesna]] and [[James Gimzewski]],&lt;ref name=&quot;r5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= At the intersection of art and science: NANO|work= Los Angeles County Museum of Art|url=http://www.nisenet.org/catalog/exhibits/nano_-_los_angeles_county_museum_art_exhbition|author1=Vesna, V.  |author2=Gimzewski, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regular &quot;Science as Art&quot; section launched at the 2006 Materials Research Society Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org/science-as-art/ Science as Art]. mrs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomczyk2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Tomczyk | first=Michael | title=NanoInnovation: What Every Manager Needs to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtGRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|date= 2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-32672-3|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic example of nanoart is ''[[A Boy and His Atom]]'', a one-minute [[stop-motion animation|stop-motion animated]] film created in 2012 by [[IBM Research]] from 242 images sized by 45×25&amp;nbsp;nm, which were recorded with a [[scanning tunneling microscope]]. The movie tells the story of a boy and a wayward atom who meet and become friends. The film was accepted into the Tribeca Online Film Festival and shown at the New York Tech Meet-up and the World Science Festival.

Earlier in 2007 a book ''[[Teeny Ted from Turnip Town]]'' was created at the [[Simon Fraser University]] in Canada using a [[gallium]]-ion beam with a diameter of ~7 nanometers. The book contains 30 [[silicon]]-based pages sized by 0.07×0.10&amp;nbsp;mm; it was published in 100 copies and has an [[ISBN]] number.

In 2015, [[Jonty Hurwitz]] pioneered a new technique for creating nanosculpture using [[multiphoton lithography]] and [[photogrammetry]]. His work ''Trust'' was prepared in collaboration with [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] as the &quot;Smallest Sculpture of a Human Form&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.201502382 |pmid=26671704 |author1=Yetisen, A.
