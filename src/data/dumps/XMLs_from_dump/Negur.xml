'''Negur''' ({{lang-fa|نگور}}, also [[Romanize]]d as '''Negūr''', '''Nigor''', '''Nīgvār''', and '''Nī Kor''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GEOnet3|-3076791}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in and capital of [[Dashtiari District]], in [[Chah Bahar County]], [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]], [[Iran]]. At the 2006 census, its population was 3,759, in 647 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{IranCensus2006|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Negur is a [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]] word meaning &quot;foothill&quot; and is the name of many other locations in the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Pakistani]] and Iranian parts of [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Baluchistan]].

==Population==
The original inhabitants of Negur were from the [[Baloch people|Baluchi]] tribe of Shaikhzadah, who according to inscriptions on gravestones lived there before the invasion of the [[Mongols|Mongolians]].  The existence of considerable underground water resources seems to have been the main reason for settling in Negur.

In 1969, after Negur became an independent municipality, many people including government staff migrated to the town from other parts of the country.  In recent years severe drought accelerated the immigration of people from other parts of Dashtyari district, posing a serious threat to water resources. Today's population of Negur is about 8,000,  mainly immigrants.
