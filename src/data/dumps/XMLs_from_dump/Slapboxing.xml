      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Slapboxing''' (or '''slap-boxing''') is a physical activity somewhat simulating [[boxing]], where open handed slaps are used instead of fists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirk |first1=Jason |title=Miles on Fournette's slapbox video and Snapchat |url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/8/10/12429296/leonard-fournette-boxing-lsu-football-video |accessdate=4 April 2019 |work=SBNation.com |date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montville substitute teacher charged with supervising 'fight club' |url=https://www.theday.com/article/20180412/NWS04/180419822 |accessdate=4 April 2019 |work=The Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quasi-martial art form, at an intersection between [[sparring]] and [[fighting]], is usually performed in an [[ad hoc]] or informal manner, or when boxing protective gear is unavailable. Although a popular pastime in some circles, it is generally not considered a competitive sport, but rather a game or training drill.

Several [[rappers]] including [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Noreaga]], [[Killarmy]], [[Eminem]], [[Ice Cube]], [[R.A. The Rugged Man]], and [[Brother Ali]] have songs in which they reminisce about slapboxing. Author [[Victor D. LaValle]] wrote the critically acclaimed ''Slapboxing with Jesus'', a story about teenagers living in [[Queens, New York]]. The book's title is a take on a line from [[Ghostface Killah]]'s '''Daytona 500'''.

In a 2004 [[Dateline NBC]] interview, singer [[Bobby Brown]] claimed to have been slapboxing with [[Whitney Houston]] when it turned violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bobby Brown Told To Turn Himself In |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67395/bobby-brown-told-to-turn-himself-in |accessdate=4 April 2019 |work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
