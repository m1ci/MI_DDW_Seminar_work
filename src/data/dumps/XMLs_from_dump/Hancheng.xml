In ancient times, [[Yu the Great]] bored a tunnel in the nearby [[Mount Longmen (Shanxi)|Mount Longmen]] (Dragon Gate Mountain) to alleviate the frequent flooding that occurred in the area, which led to the area being called ''Dragon Gate'' ({{lang|zh-hant|龍門}}). During the [[Western Zhou]] Dynasty, the area was bestowed on the [[Han (state)|Han]] Marquises. During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the area was under the administration of the [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] and became known as ''Hanyuan'' ({{lang|zh-hant|韓原}}) or &quot;Land of the Hans.&quot; In the [[Warring States period]], the area belonged to the [[State of Wei]] and was called ''Shaoliang'' ({{lang|zh|少梁}}). Towards the end of the Warring States Period, the [[State of Qin]] conquered and designated the area as ''Xiayang County'' ({{lang|zh-hans|夏阳县}}). In the [[Sui Dynasty]], the area received its present name of Hancheng.

In 1983, Hancheng County became Hancheng City. In 1986, the city was named a ''National Historic and Cultural City'' ({{lang|zh-hans|[[:zh:国家历史文化名城|国家历史文化名城]]}}) and, {{cn-span|in 2007, was added to the list of ''Prime Tourist Cities of China'' ({{lang|zh-hans|中国优秀旅游城市}}).|date=June 2018}}

==Economy==

The famed Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]] was born in Hancheng in the [[Han Dynasty]] and buried nearby.
