'''Bolekhiv''' ({{lang-uk|Болехів}}; {{lang-pl|Bolechów}}; {{lang-yi|באָלעכאָוו}}) is a regional city in [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of [[Ukraine]]. It was once home to a large [[Judaism|Jewish]] community, very few of whom survived [[World War II]]. Administratively, Bolekhiv is incorporated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of regional significance]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|21,610}}.

== History ==
Bolekhiv is first mentioned in historical records in 1371 after the defeat of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] to [[Poland]]. During the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]] in the 14th century, Bolekhiv was variously held by [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] ([[Danylo Dazhbohovych]]), and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Subsequently, King [[Jogaila]] of Poland succeeded and Bolekhiv became part of the Kingdom of Poland.

In 1546, Emilia Hrosovska established a [[salt]] refinery in the town. In 1603, [[Sigismund III Vasa]] gave the town the [[Magdeburg rights]]. At that time, the Bolekhiv region was involved with the [[Opryshky]] movement led by [[Oleksa Dovbush]] and [[Germany|German]] colonists arrived.

After World War II, Bolekhiv became a [[raion]] (a region of local governance). In 1964, its raion was merged with [[Dolyna Raion]]. Since 1993 the city has been governed by the [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]].

A Jewish community existed in Bolekhiv (Yiddish pronunciation: Bolechov) since its establishment by Nicholas Gydzincki. The town founder proclaimed equal rights to the three ethnic groups living there, Jews, [[Polish Catholicism|Polish Catholics]] and [[Ruthenians]] ([[Ukrainians]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]]), and this was confirmed by [[Sigismund III Vasa]], the king of the new [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], formerly [[crown prince]] of [[Poland]], the [[grand duke of Lithuania]], and later to become king of [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1247&amp;letter=B JewishEncyclopedia.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629102046/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1247&amp;letter=B |date=29 June 2011 }} according to the 19th-century book [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46627&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=8 &quot;Memories of Reb Dov of Bolechov&quot; page 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224607/http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46627&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=8 |date=12 March 2014 }}. The mayor of the town could be from any of the ethnic groups and would swear to care for all three.&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was a privately owned town, and the changes of ownership or inheritance had a strong impact on all the residents of the town, especially the Jews. In 1670, after the [[Tatars]] invaded and burnt the town down, the town owner gave the Jews a large loan to rebuild. Towards the middle of the 19th century there was much tension between the Jews and the other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;Memories of Reb Dov of Bolichov, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Hassidic]] rebbe, Rabbi Shneibalg, &quot;the Rebbe of Bolechov&quot;, had a large Hassidic court in the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhol.co.il/article.aspx?id=52954 Rabbi Shneibalg, the Bolohover Rebbe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312003636/http://www.bhol.co.il/article.aspx?id=52954 |date=12 March 2014 }} (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1890, seventy-five percent of the population of Bolekhiv (4,237 people) was Jewish.&lt;ref name=&quot;bartov&quot;&gt;Bartov O. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CbofiWD2hL0C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=bolekhiv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YQsLU-2INIz8lAXo6ICgBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bolekhiv&amp;f=false &quot;Erased: vanishing traces of Jewish Galicia in present day Ukraine.&quot;] Princeton University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|069113121X}}, 9780691131214 p73 – 74. Accessed at Google Books 24 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atrocities began in 1935, by a hostile government and population, and escalated after the German conquest in 1941.

By 1940 the Jewish population of Bolekhiv reached about 3,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;popAdded&quot;&gt;''The Lost'' page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 and 29 October 1941, four months after capturing the town, the German police carried out a first ''Aktion'' (German annihilation operation) in Bolekhiv, which included a list of 1,000 of the Jewish rabbis, leaders, doctors and richer people, who were tortured for two days, and then shot in a nearby forest, some buried alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishgen&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/bolekhov/bol117.html Bolechov remembered] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727210247/http://www2.jewishgen.org/yizkor/bolekhov/bol117.html |date=27 July 2013 }} (JewishGen website)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 and 1942 thousands of Jews were added to the population, from the surrounding towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;popAdded&quot; /&gt;

About a year later, 3 to 5 September 1942, the Germans planned a second Aktion. The Jews were warned in advance by a member of their [[Judenrat]] who was in a nearby town, but many of the local Ukrainians began a murder spree in the preceding afternoon, targeting mainly children, in horrific acts of barbarity. The Germans joined in the action, and continued to grab people from their houses or hiding places.
About 1,500 Jews were murdered, 600-700 of them children, and an additional 2,000 Jews were sent to the [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] [[Extermination camp|death camp]] where most were subsequently murdered.

Other Aktions continued into 1943 when the surviving 900 Jews, working in makeshift &quot;work groups&quot;, were marched to the cemetery nearby, in groups of 100 or 200, and shot.

Only 48 Jews of the town survived [[World War II]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bartov&quot; /&gt;

== Geography ==

It shares borders with [[Dolyna Raion]] (east), [[Lviv Oblast]] (north, southwest and west), [[Zhydachiv Raion]], [[Stryi Raion]], and [[Skole Raion]]. Two rivers, the Sukil and the Svicha, run through the town before joining the [[Dniester]]. The [[Carpathian Mountains]] lie to the southwest. Bolekhiv is on Ukraine highway 10 between [[Dolyna]] and [[Stryi]]. The capital, [[Kiev]] is approximately 300&amp;nbsp;km away in a west northwesterly direction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=bolechow&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x473a119da2b1205d:0xb53c70481705f385,Bolekhiv,+Ivano-Frankivs'ka+oblast,+Ukraine&amp;gl=au&amp;ei=Ht4KU6ajBpD0oAT90oGIAg&amp;ved=0CHwQtgM &quot;Bolekhiv.&quot;] Google Maps.
