== About The Founder ==
Badarka was founded  in 1643 AD by Raja Harbans, an official at the court of Shah Jahan, who received a grant of 500 Bighas from the Emperor in pargana Harha. He built a fine house here with walls of limestone blocks to a height of about 500m, surmounted with turreted walls, on an elaborate frieze of red stone over the gateway, having alternately Geese &amp; Elephants in pairs. A large hall of audience supported on carved pillars formerly stood here, but [[Asaf-ud-daula]] is said to have taken these pillars to help building [[Imambara]] at [[Lucknow]].

The house built by Raja Harbans was very picturesque and massive, and the strength of its construction was calculated to defy the hands of time.
