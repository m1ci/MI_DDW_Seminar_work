'''Skibobbing''' (also called '''skibiking''' or '''snowbiking''') is a [[winter sport]] involving a bicycle-type frame attached to skis instead of wheels and sometimes a set of foot skis. The use of foot skis is what defines &quot;skibobbing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ski|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDytu6Z6yvcC&amp;pg=PA92|date=January 1970|pages=92–94|id={{ISSN|0037-6159}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although skibobs are often called ski bikes or snow bikes,&lt;ref name=skibob&gt;{{cite web|title=SkiBob|url=http://www.holz-schlitten.de/SkiBob_idQQ1ZZmodeQQartlistZZcatQQ7|publisher=www.holz-schlitten.de|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are different, and the sport should also not be confused with [[snowbiking]],&lt;ref name=skibob /&gt; which is the sport or recreation of bicycling on [[snow]].

Type-1 skibobs have no suspension. Suspended designs are Type-2 'freestyle' skibobs.

==History==
Although the original idea for a bicycle with skis was patented as early as 1892, and skibobbing had been a form of transportation in the [[Alps]], it was not until 1954 that the first international race was held. Seven years later, the FISB (Fédération Internationále de Skibob) was formed, which since 1967 has held an annual Skibobbing World Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skibike.net/History.htm Skibike.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, skibobbing was one of the very few methods by which {{clarify-span|text=people without strength in their knees|date=December 2019}} could [[alpine ski]], but it soon became a popular sport amongst the physically able, too.  The main attractions are said to be the speeds attained (in some skibob [[giant slalom]] races, speeds of {{convert|120|mph}} or more{{source?|date=December 2019}} can be reached) and the feeling of [[jet skiing]] on snow.

Austrian skibobber [[Erich Brenter]] is noted for setting the first world record for downhill skibobbing speed in 1964, at {{Convert|102|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836821,00.html?promoid=googlep Time (magazine): 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;
