It is the seventh most populous city in Italy, at the heart of a [[Metropolitan City of Bologna|metropolitan area]] of about one million people.

Of [[Etrusca]]n origin, the city has been a major urban centre for centuries, first under the Etruscans, then under the Romans (''Bononia''), then again in the [[Middle Ages]], as a free municipality and signoria, when it was among the [[List of largest European cities in history|largest European cities by population]]. Famous for its towers, churches and lengthy [[portico]]es, Bologna has a well-preserved historical centre, thanks to a careful restoration and conservation policy which began at the end of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Romy Grieco, ''Bologna: a city to discover''(1976) pp 8-12, 138-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Home to the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest university in the world]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2007/overall_rankings/worlds_oldest_universities/  Top Universities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117202932/http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2007/overall_rankings/worlds_oldest_universities/ |date=17 January 2009 }} ''World University Rankings'' Retrieved 6 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.unibo.it/PortaleEn/University/Our+History/default.htm Our History] – Università di Bologna&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyjnHZ1IIlgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=the+oldest+university+in+the+world+Bologna#v=onepage |title=The Challenge of Bologna|author=Paul L.

Bologna is an important agricultural, industrial, financial and transport hub, where many large mechanical, electronic and food companies have their headquarters as well as one of the largest permanent trade fairs in Europe. According to the most recent data gathered by the European Regional Economic Growth Index (E-REGI) of 2009, Bologna is the first Italian city and the 47th European city in terms of its economic growth rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;citymayors.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/europe-growth-cities.html |title=European growth cities |publisher=City Mayors |date= |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Bologna is also one of the wealthiest cities in Italy, often ranking as one of the top cities in terms of quality of life in the country: in 2011 it ranked 1st out of 107 Italian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/qvita_2011/home.shtml |title=Qualità della vita |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729122929/http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/qvita_2011/home.shtml |archive-date=29 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traces of human habitation in the area of Bologna go back to the 3rd millennium BCE, with significant settlements from about the 9th century BCE ([[Villanova culture]]). 
The influence of [[Etruscan civilization]] reached the area in the 7th to 6th centuries, and the Etruscan city of ''Felsina'' was founded at the site of Bologna by the end of the 6th century.
By the 4th century BCE, the site was occupied by the [[Gauls|Gaulish]] [[Boii]], and it became  a Roman colony and municipium with the name of ''Bononia'' in 196 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hornblower|display-authors=et al|first1=Simon|title=The Oxford classical dictionary.|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199545568|page=230|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Bologna, then a frontier outpost of the [[Byzantine]] [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], was repeatedly sacked by the [[Goths]]; it is in this period that legendary Bishop [[St. Petronius|Petronius]], according to ancient chronicles, rebuilt the ruined town and founded the [[Santo Stefano, Bologna|basilica of Saint Stephen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Alban|title=The Lives Of The Fathers, Martyrs, And Other Principal Saints|date=1814|publisher=John Murphy|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petronius is still revered as patron saint of Bologna.

In 727-28, the city was sacked and captured by the [[Lombards|Lombard]] under King [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], becoming part of that kingdom. These Germanic conquerors built an important new quarter, called &quot;addizione longobarda&quot; (Italian for &quot;Longobard addition&quot;) near the complex of St. Stephen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heers|first1=Jacques|title=La città nel medioevo in Occidente : paesaggi, poteri e conflitti|date=1995|publisher=Jaca Book|location=Milano|isbn=978-8816403741|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last quarter of the 8th century, [[Charlemagne]], at the request of Pope [[Adrian I]], invaded the Lombard Kingdom, causing its eventual demise. Occupied by Frankish troops in 774 on behalf of the papacy, Bologna remained under imperial authority and prospered as a frontier mark of the [[Carolingian empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinhenz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleinhenz|first1=Christopher|title=Medieval Italy : an encyclopedia|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415939294|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Matilda of Tuscany]] in 1115, Bologna obtained substantial concessions from Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. However, when [[Frederick Barbarossa]] subsequently attempted to strike down the deal, Bologna joined the [[Lombard League]], which then defeated the imperial armies at the [[Battle of Legnano]] and established an effective autonomy at the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183. Subsequently, the town began to expand rapidly and became one of the main commercial trade centres of northern Italy thanks to a system of canals that allowed barges and ships to come and go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luzzatto|first1=Gino|title=An Economic History of Italy: From the Fall of the Empire to the Beginning of the 16th Century|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon-on-Thames|isbn=978-1138864955|page=111|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believed to have been established in 1088, the [[University of Bologna]] is widely considered the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest university in continuous operation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt Janin 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridder-Symoens 1992&quot;/&gt; The university originated as a centre for the study of [[medieval Roman law]] under major [[glossator]]s, including [[Irnerius]]. It numbered [[Dante]], [[Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]] among its students.&lt;ref name=unibo&gt;[http://www.unibo.it/Portale/Ateneo/La+nostra+storia/NoveSecoli.htm Nove secoli di storia] – Università di Bologna&lt;/ref&gt; The medical school was especially renowned.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy G. Siraisi, ''Taddeo Alderotti and his pupils: two generations of Italian medical learning'' (Princeton University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1200, Bologna was a thriving commercial and artisanal centre of about 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janin|first1=Hunt|title=The university in medieval life, 1179-1499|date=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=978-0786434626|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a campaign to support the imperial cities of [[Modena]] and [[Cremona]] against Bologna, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]'s son, [[Enzo of Sardinia|King Enzo of Sardinia]], was defeated and captured on 26 May 1249 at the [[Battle of Fossalta]]. Though the emperor demanded his release, Enzo was thenceforth kept a knightly prisoner in Bologna, in a palace that came to be named [[Palazzo Re Enzo]] after him. Every attempt to escape or to rescue him failed, and he died after more than 22 years in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnaldi|first1=Girolamo|title=Italy and its invaders|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0674030336|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his half-brothers [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] in 1254, [[Frederick of Antioch]] in 1256 and [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]] in 1266, as well as the execution his nephew [[Conradin]] in 1268, he was the last of the Hohenstaufen heirs.

During the late 1200s, Bologna was affected by political instability when the most prominent families incessantly fought for the control of the town. The free commune was severely weakened by decades of infighting, allowing the Pope to impose the rule of his envoy Cardinal [[Bertrand du Pouget]] in 1327. Du Pouget was eventually ousted by a popular rebellion and Bologna became a [[signoria]] under Taddeo Pepoli in 1334.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Partner|first1=Peter|title=The lands of St. Peter : the papal state in the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance|date=1972|publisher=Univ. of California Pr.|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520021815|pages=[https://archive.org/details/landsofstpeterpa0000part/page/318 318–327]|url=https://archive.org/details/landsofstpeterpa0000part/page/318}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in 1348, Bologna had 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants, reduced to just 20,000 to 25,000 after the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wray|first1=Shona Kelly|title=Communities and crisis : Bologna during the Black Death|date=2009|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-9004176348|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1350, Bologna was conquered by [[Archbishop]] [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], the new lord of Milan. However, following a rebellion by the town's governor, a renegade member of the Visconti family, Bologna was recuperated to the papacy in 1363 by Cardinal [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz]] after a long negotiation involving a huge indemnity paid to [[Bernabò Visconti]], Giovanni's heir, who died in 1354.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partner&quot;/&gt; In 1376, Bologna again revolted against Papal rule and joined Florence in the unsuccessful [[War of the Eight Saints]]. However, extreme infighting inside the Holy See after the [[Western Schism]] prevented the papacy from restoring its domination over Bologna, so it remained relatively independent for some decades as an oligarchic republic. In 1401, [[Giovanni I Bentivoglio]] took power in a coup with the support of Milan, but the Milanese, having turned his back on them and allied with Florence, marched on Bologna and had Giovanni killed the following year. In 1442, [[Annibale I Bentivoglio|Hannibal I Bentivoglio]], Giovanni's nephew, recovered Bologna from the Milanese, only to be assassinated in a conspiracy plotted by Pope [[Eugene IV]] three years later. But the [[signoria]] of the [[Bentivoglio family]] was then firmly established, and the power passed to his cousin [[Sante Bentivoglio]], who ruled until 1462, followed by [[Giovanni II Bentivoglio|Giovanni II]]. Giovanni II managed to resist the expansionist designs of [[Cesare Borgia]] for some time, but on 7 October 1506, Pope [[Julius II]] issued a bull deposing and [[excommunication|excommunicating]] Bentivoglio and placing the city under [[interdict]]. When the papal troops, along with a contingent sent by [[Louis XII of France]], marched against Bologna, Bentivoglio and his family fled. Julius II entered the city triumphantly on 10 November.

===Early modern===
[[File:Mappa di Bologna del Blaeu.jpg|thumb|Bologna in 1640.]]

The period of Papal rule over Bologna (1506&amp;ndash;1796) has been generally evaluated by historians as one of severe decline. 
However, this was not evident in the 1500s, which were marked by some major developments in Bologna. In 1530, [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] in Bologna, the last of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s to be crowned by the pope.
In 1564, the Piazza del Nettuno and the [[Palazzo dei Banchi]] were built, along with the [[Archiginnasio]], the main building of the university. The period of Papal rule saw also the construction of many churches and other religious establishments, and the restoration of older ones. At this time, Bologna had ninety-six convents, more than any other Italian city. Painters working in Bologna during this period established the [[Bolognese School]] which includes [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Domenichino]], [[Guercino]] and others of European fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raimond Van Marle 1924 pp 394-481&quot;&gt;Raimond Van Marle. ''The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, Volume 4''  (1924) pp 394-481.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alberti History of Bologna 1590.jpg|thumb|Engraving of the city of Bologna from [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''History of Bologna'', 1590, showing the two surviving towers and several others]]

It was only towards the end of the 16th century that severe signs of decline began to manifest. A series of plagues in the late 16th to early 17th century reduced the population of the city from some 72,000 in the mid-16th century to some 47,000 by 1630.  During the [[1629-31 Italian plague|Italian Plague of 1629–31]] alone Bologna lost up to a third of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black |first1=Christopher F.|title=Early Modern Italy a Social History |date=2001 |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415214346|page=23|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-17th century, population stabilized at roughly 60,000, slowly increasing to some 70,000 by the mid-18th century. The economy of Bologna started to show signs of severe decline as the global centres of trade shifted towards the Atlantic. The traditional silk industry was in a critical state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Pullan |editor-first=Brian |title=Crisis and change in the Venetian economy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries |date=2006| publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0415377003 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was losing students, that once came from all over Europe, because of the illiberal attitudes of the Church towards culture (especially after the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gross |first1=Hanns|title=Rome in the Age of Enlightenment : the Post-Tridentine Syndrome and the Ancien Regime |date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0521893787|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bologna continued to suffer a progressive deindustrialisation also in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross |first=Hanns |title=Rome in the Age of Enlightenment : the Post-Tridentine Syndrome and the Ancien Regime|date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0521893787 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1700s pope [[Benedict XIV]], a Bolognese, tried to reverse the decline of the city with a series of reforms intended to stimulate the economy and promoting the arts. However, these reforms achieved only mixed results. The pope's efforts to stimulate the decaying textile industry had little success, while he was more successful in reforming the tax system and liberalising trade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=A.D.|title=The early modern papacy : from the Council of Trent to the French Revolution, 1564-1789|date=2000|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow, England |isbn=978-0582087477 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relaxed the oppressive system of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messberger |display-authors=et al |first1=Rebecca|title=Benedict XIV and the Enlightenment: Art, Science, and Spirituality|date=2016 |publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto |isbn=978-1442637184 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic and demographic decline of Bologna became even more noticeable starting from the second half of the 18th century. In 1790 the city had 72,000 inhabitants, ranking as the second largest in the Papal States; however this figure had remained unchanged for decades. The economy was stagnant because of Papal policies that distorted trade with heavy custom dues and sold concessions of monopolies to single manufacturers thus lowering competition, depressing productivity and incentivising corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearder|first1=Harry|title=Italy in the age of the Risorgimento : 1790 - 1870|date=1994|publisher=Longman|location=London|isbn=978-0582491465|page=121|edition=7. impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
[[File:Bologna Piazza Maggiore c1855.jpg|thumb|Piazza del Nettuno in 1855, looking towards Piazza Maggiore.]]

[[Napoleon]] entered Bologna on 19 June 1796. Napoleon briefly reinstated the ancient mode of government, giving power to the Senate, which however had to swear fealty to the short lived [[Cispadane Republic]], created as   a [[client state]] of the [[Napoleonic empire|French Empire]] at the congress of Reggio (27 December 1796 &amp;ndash; 9 January 1797) but succeeded by the [[Cisalpine Republic]] on  9 July 1797, later by the [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]] and finally the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. 
After the fall of Napoleon, the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 restored Bologna to the [[Papal State]]s. 
Papal rule was contested in the [[Revolutions of 1830|uprisings of 1831]]. The insurrected provinces planned to unite as the ''[[Province Italiane Unite]]'' with Bologna as capital. [[Pope Gregory XVI]] asked for 
[[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] help against the rebels. [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] warned French king [[Louis Philippe I]] against intervention in Italian affairs, and in  the spring of 1831, Austrian forces marched across the Italian peninsula, defeating the rebellion by 26 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Italian_unification_-_Early_revolutionary_activity_1820_to_1830/id/1517955 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221914/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Italian_unification_-_Early_revolutionary_activity_1820_to_1830/id/1517955 |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1840s, unemployment levels were very high and traditional industries continued to languish or disappear; Bologna became a city of economic disparity with the top 10 percent of the population living off rent, another 20 percent exercising professions or commerce and 70 percent working in low-paid, often insecure manual jobs. The Papal census of 1841 reported 10,000 permanent beggars and another 30,000 (out of a total population of 70,000) who lived in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Steven C.|title=Crime, disorder, and the Risorgimento : the politics of policing in Bologna|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521444507|page=17|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the [[revolutions of 1848]] the Austrian garrisons which controlled the city on behalf of the Pope were temporarily expelled, but eventually came back and crushed the revolutionaries. 

Papal rule finally ended in the aftermath of [[Second War of Italian Independence]], when the French and Pidemontese troops expelled the Austrians from Italian lands, on 11 and 12 March 1860, Bologna voted to join the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].
In the last decades of the 19th century, Bologna once again thrived economically and socially.

After [[World War I]], Bologna was heavily involved in the [[Biennio Rosso]] socialist uprisings. As a consequence, the traditionally moderate elites of the city turned their back on the progressive faction and gave their support to the rising [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement of [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cardoza|first1=Anthony L.|title=Agrarian Elites and Italian Fascism: The Province of Bologna, 1901-1926|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691641409|pages=387–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dino Grandi]], a high-ranking Fascist party official and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, remembered for being an Anglophile, was from Bologna. During the [[interwar years]], Bologna developed into an important manufacturing centre for food processing, agricultural machinery and metalworking. The Fascist regime poured in massive investments, for example with the setting up of a giant tobacco manufacturing plant in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sabel|display-authors=et al|first1=Charles F.|title=World of possibilities : flexibility and mass production in western industrialization|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

====World War II====
Bologna suffered extensive damage during [[World War II]]. The strategic importance of the city as an industrial and railway hub connecting northern and central Italy made it a target for the Allied forces. On 24 July 1943, a massive aerial bombardment destroyed a significant part of the historic city centre and killed about 200 people. The main railway station and adjoining areas were severely hit, and 44% of the buildings in the centre were listed as having been destroyed or severely damaged. The city was heavily bombed again on 25 September. The raids, which this time were not confined to the city centre, left more than 1,000 people dead and thousands injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manaresi|first1=Filippo D'Ajutolo.

After the [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice of 1943]], the city became a key centre of the [[Italian resistance movement]]. On 7 November 1944, a pitched battle around [[Porta Lame, Bologna|Porta Lame]], waged by partisans of the 7th Brigade of the ''Gruppi d'Azione Patriottica'' against [[Italian Social Republic|Fascist]] and Nazi occupation forces, did not succeed in triggering a general uprising, despite being one of the largest resistance-led urban conflicts in the European theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://certosa.cineca.it/2/eventi.php?TBL=EVENTI_STORICI&amp;ID=21 |title=7 novembre 1944&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;Battaglia di Porta Lame |work=Il Museo Virtuale della Certosa |publisher=Certosa.cineca.it |language=Italian |accessdate=2 May 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707025053/http://certosa.cineca.it/2/eventi.php?TBL=EVENTI_STORICI&amp;ID=21 |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance forces entered Bologna on the morning of 21 April 1945. By this time, the Germans had already largely left the city in the face of the Allied advance, spearheaded by Polish forces advancing from the east during the [[Battle of Bologna]] which had been fought since 9 April. First to arrive in the centre was the 87th Infantry Regiment of the Friuli Combat Group under general [[Arturo Scattini]], who entered the centre from ''Porta Maggiore'' to the south. Since the soldiers were dressed in British outfits, they were initially thought to be part of the allied forces; when the local inhabitants heard the soldiers were speaking Italian, they poured out onto the streets to celebrate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====Cold war period====
[[File:Stragedibologna-2.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the 1980 terrorist bombing.]]
In the post-war years, Bologna became a thriving industrial centre as well as a political stronghold of the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Between 1945 and 1999, the city was helmed by an uninterrupted succession of [[List of mayors of Bologna#Democratic Mayors|mayors]] from the PCI and its successors, the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] and [[Democrats of the Left]], the first of whom was [[Giuseppe Dozza]]. At the end of the 1960s the city authorities, worried by massive [[gentrification]] and [[suburbanisation]], asked Japanese [[starchitect]] [[Kenzo Tange]] to sketch a master plan for a [[new town]] north of Bologna; however, the project that came out in 1970 was evaluated as too ambitious and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heath|display-authors=et al|first1=Tim|title=Revitalizing historic urban quarters|date=2001|publisher=Architectural Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0750628907|page=107|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the city council, in spite of vetoing Tange's master plan, decided to keep his project for a [[Fiera District in Bologna, Italy|new exhibition centre and business district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghirardo|first1=Diane Yvonne|title=Italy: Modern Architectures in History|date=2013|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=978-1861898647|page=283|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1978 the construction of a tower block and several diverse buildings and structures started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Chronology of Bologna: 1927&quot; (in Italian)|url=http://www.bibliotecasalaborsa.it/cronologia/bologna/1978/929|website=www.bibliotecasalaborsa.it|publisher=[[Biblioteca Salaborsa|Salaborsa Library]]|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 the headquarters of the regional government of [[Emilia-Romagna]] moved in the new district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;La Regione e la sua storia - le sedi della regione&quot; (in Italian)|url=http://www.regione.emilia-romagna.it/storia/sedi|website=www.regione.emilia-romagna.it|publisher=Emilia-Romagna region|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Bologna was the scene of [[Movement of 1977#The riots|rioting]] linked to the [[Movement of 1977]], a spontaneous political movement of the time. The police shooting of a [[far-left]] activist, [[Francesco Lorusso]], sparked two days of street clashes.  On 2 August 1980, at the height of the &quot;[[Years of Lead (Italy)|years of lead]]&quot;, a terrorist bomb was set off in the central railway station of Bologna killing 85 people and wounding 200, an event which is known in Italy as the [[Bologna massacre]]. In 1995, members of the [[neo-fascist]] group [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] were convicted for carrying out the attack, while [[Licio Gelli]]—Grand Master of the underground Freemason lodge [[Propaganda Due|Propaganda Due (P2)]]—was convicted for hampering the investigation, together with three agents of the secret military intelligence service [[SISMI]] (including [[Francesco Pazienza]] and [[Pietro Musumeci]]). Commemorations take place in Bologna on 2 August each year, culminating in a concert in the main square.

====Recent history====
In 1999 the long tradition of left-wing mayors was interrupted by the victory of independent centre-right candidate [[Giorgio Guazzaloca]]. However, Bologna reverted to form in 2004 when [[Sergio Cofferati]], a former trade union leader, unseated Guazzaloca. The next centre-left mayor, [[Flavio Delbono]], elected in June 2009, resigned in January 2010 after being involved in a corruption scandal. After a 15-month period in which the city was administered under [[Anna Maria Cancellieri]] (as a state-appointed [[Prefect#Modern sub-national administration|prefect]]), [[Virginio Merola]] was elected as mayor, leading a left-wing coalition comprising the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], [[Left Ecology Freedom]] and [[Italy of Values]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bipr.eu/eventprofile.cfm/idevent=4C9098ED-F72A-7A24-FA7CEF9C574BD7D9/Virginio-Merola---Mayor-of-Bologna-Benvenuti-a-Bologna---Welcome-to-Bologna&amp;zdyx=1 Virginio Merola. &quot;Benvenuti a Bologna - Welcome to Bologna&quot; Oct 18, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Territory===
[[File:Luftbild Bologna 01 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Bologna (from East to West).]]
Bologna is situated on the edge of the [[Po Valley|Po Plain]] at the foot of the [[Apennine Mountains]], at the meeting of the [[Reno (river)|Reno]] and [[Savena]] river valleys. As Bologna's two main watercourses flow directly to the sea, the town lies outside of the drainage basin of the [[Po river|River Po]]. The [[Bologna (province)|Province of Bologna]] stretches from the western edge of the Po Plain on the border with [[Ferrara]] to the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. The centre of the town is {{convert|54|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (while elevation within the municipality ranges from {{convert|29|m|ft}} in the suburb of Corticella to {{convert|300|m|ft}} in Sabbiuno and the Colle della Guardia). The Province of Bologna stretches from the Po Plain into the Apennines; the highest point in the province is the peak of Corno alle Scale (in [[Lizzano in Belvedere]]) at {{convert|1945|m|ft}} above sea level.

===Climate===
Bologna has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'').

Annual precipitation oscillates between around {{convert|450|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;stat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.bologna.it/iperbole/piancont/dati_statistici/Indici/Ambiente%20e%20territorio/index.htm |title=Dati statistici temperature e precipitazioni dal 1991 al 2009 |publisher=comune.bologna.it |date= |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority generally falling in spring and autumn. The last major snow event was in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arpa.emr.it/cms3/documenti/_cerca_doc/ecoscienza/ecoscienza2012_1/nanni_es1_12.pdf |title=Febbraio 2012, ma quanta neve è caduta? |publisher= ARPA Emilia-Romagna |date= |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal government===

[[File:Virginio Merola 2016.jpeg|left|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Virginio Merola]], mayor of Bologna since 2011.]]
[[File:Districts of Bologna.png|thumb|left|The six boroughs of Bologna.]]
The legislative body of the [[Italian communes|municipality]] is the [[City Council of Bologna|City Council]] (''Consiglio Comunale''), which is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a corrected proportional system (granting the majority to the list or alliance of lists which receives more votes), contextually to the mayoral elections.  The executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed by 12 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]], that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected [[List of mayors of Bologna|Mayor]]. The current mayor of Bologna is [[Virginio Merola]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|PD]]), elected on 16 May 2011 with the 50.5% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dipartimento per gli Affari Interni e Territoriali |url=https://elezionistorico.interno.gov.it/index.php |website=elezionistorico.interno.gov.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 2016 Merola was re-elected in a second-round ballot with 54.64% of votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/bologna/risultati-ballottaggio-merola-sindaco-1.2272898 Ballottaggio 2016, Merola confermato sindaco]&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality of Bologna is subdivided into six administrative Boroughs (''Quartieri''), down from the former nine before the 2015 administrative reform. Each Borough is governed by a Council (''Consiglio'') and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organization is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities.

=== Provincial and regional government ===
[[File:Fiera District View - Bologna.jpg|thumb|right|Fiera District, seat of the regional government of Emilia-Romagna.]]
Bologna is the capital of the eponymous metropolitan city and of [[Emilia-Romagna]], one of the twenty [[Regions of Italy|regions]] of Italy. While the Province of Bologna has a population of 1,007,644,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demographic Balance for the year 2017 (provisional data)|url=http://demo.istat.it/bilmens2017gen/index.html|publisher=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|Istat]]|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the twelfth most populated province of Italy, Emilia-Romagna ranks as the sixth most populated region of Italy, with about 4.5 million inhabitants, more than 7% of the national total. The seat of the regional government is [[Fiera District in Bologna, Italy|Fiera District]], a tower complex designed by Japanese [[architect]] [[Kenzo Tange]] in 1985.

According to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganisation, the urban area of Bologna is one of the 15 [[Metropolitan municipalities of Italy|Metropolitan municipalities]] (''città metropolitane''), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spending Review Act |url=http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/Comunicati/dettaglio.asp?d=68656 |publisher=Italian Government |accessdate=18 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714005846/http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/Comunicati/dettaglio.asp?d=68656 |archivedate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better co-ordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferri&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unicreditreviews.com/uploads/03_ferri_ing_201-236.pdf |title=Metropolitan cities in Italy.

The Metropolitan City of Bologna is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (''Sindaco metropolitano'') and by the Metropolitan Council (''Consiglio metropolitano''). Since 21 June 2016 [[Virginio Merola]], as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.

Until the late 19th century, when a large-scale urban renewal project was undertaken, Bologna was one of the few remaining large walled cities in Europe; to this day and despite having suffered considerable bombing damage in 1944, Bologna's {{convert|350|acre|0|order=flip}} historic centre is Europe's second largest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = National League of Cities, American Municipal Association|title = Nation's cities, Volume 14|publisher = National League of Cities |year = 1976 |location = United States |pages = |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; containing an immense wealth of important medieval, renaissance, and baroque artistic monuments.

Bologna developed along the [[Via Emilia]] as an Etruscan and later Roman colony; the Via Emilia still runs straight through the city under the changing names of Strada Maggiore, Rizzoli, Ugo Bassi, and San Felice. Due to its Roman heritage, the central streets of Bologna, today largely pedestrianized, follow the grid pattern of the Roman settlement. The original Roman ramparts were supplanted by a high medieval system of fortifications, remains of which are still visible, and finally by a third and final set of ramparts built in the 13th century, of which numerous sections survive. No more than twenty medieval defensive towers remain out of up to 180 that were built in the 12th and 13th centuries before the arrival of unified civic government. The most famous of the [[towers of Bologna]] are the central &quot;Due Torri&quot; (''Asinelli'' and ''Garisenda''), whose iconic leaning forms provide a popular symbol of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Towers: Garisenda e degli Asinelli|url=http://www.artcityemiliaromagna.com/places/bologna/the-two-towers-garisenda-e-degli-asinelli|website=artcityemiliaromagna.com|publisher=Official tourism promotion website of Emilia-Romagna region|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cityscape is further enriched by its elegant and extensive porticoes, for which the city is famous. In total, there are some {{convert|38|km|0|abbr=off}} of [[portico]]es in the city's historical centre&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=The Porticoes of Bologna|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5010/|type = [[World Heritage Site]] submission |publisher = [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Centre|date = 1 June 2006|accessdate = 29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (over {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} in the city proper), which make it possible to walk for long distances sheltered from the elements.

The windy 666 vault arcades, almost four kilometres ({{convert|3,796|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) long, effectively links ''San Luca'', as the church is commonly called, to the city centre. Its porticos provide shelter for the traditional procession which every year since 1433 has carried a Byzantine icon of the Madonna with Child attributed to [[Luke the Evangelist]] down to the [[Bologna Cathedral]] during the [[Feast of the Ascension]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;/&gt;

[[San Petronio Basilica]], built between 1388 and 1479 (but still unfinished), is the tenth-largest church in the world by volume, 132 metres long and 66 metres wide, while the vault reaches 45 metres inside and 51 metres in the facade. With its volume of 258,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, it is the largest (Gothic or otherwise) church built of bricks of the world.&lt;ref&gt;data from [http://www.bolognawelcome.com/en/places-to-see/history-art/params/CategorieLuoghi_34/Luoghi_129/ref/Basilica%20of%20San%20Petronio http://www.bolognawelcome.com, ''Basilica di San Petronio''] plus calculations as follows: 
* San Petronio de Bologna: The footplan of the building is a simple rectangle
** Area = length of the building x width of the building = 132 m x 60 m
* The volume, without the roofs, can be calculated as a sum of five cuboids, one single (the central nave) and two pairs (the aisles and the files of chapels). The sum each of the pairs can be calculated as one cuboid of double width. Knowing the height of the central nave and the width of the building, the measures of the sections can be calculated by measuring an orthograde photo of the facade.
** Volume = (traverse section of the central nave [width = 22 m, height = 44.27 m] + sum of the traverse sections of the two aisles [width = 20 m, height = 29.06 m] + sum of the traverse sections of the two files of chapels [width = 18 m, height = 22.38 m]) x length of the building [132 m]
** (973.94 + 581.2 + 402.84) x 132 = 1,957.98 x 132 = 258,453.36&lt;/ref&gt; The Basilica of [[Santo Stefano, Bologna|Saint Stephen]] and its sanctuary are among the oldest structures in Bologna, having been built starting from the 8th century, according to the tradition on the site of an ancient temple dedicated to Egyptian goddess [[Isis]]. The [[Basilica of San Domenico|Basilica of Saint Dominic]] is an example of Romanic architecture from the 13th century, enriched by the monumental tombs of great Bolognese [[glossator]]s Rolandino de'Passeggeri and Egidio Foscherari. Basilicas of [[San Francesco (Bologna)|St Francis]], [[Santa Maria dei Servi]] and [[San Giacomo Maggiore (Bologna)|San Giacomo Maggiore]] are other magnificent examples of 14th-century architecture, the latter also featuring Renaissance artworks such as the [[Pala Bentivoglio|Bentivoglio Altarpiece]] by [[Lorenzo Costa the Elder|Lorenzo Costa]]. Finally, the Church of [[San Michele in Bosco]] is a 15th-century religious complex located on a hill not far from the city's historical cente.

==Economy==
[[File:Unipol Tower 02.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Unipol Tower]], at 127&amp;nbsp;m, is the city's tallest building.]]

In terms of total GDP, the [[Metropolitan City of Bologna]] generated a value of about €35 billion ($40.6 billion) in 2017, equivalent to €34,251 ($40,165) per capita, the third highest figure among Italian provinces (after [[Metropolitan City of Milan|Milan]] and [[Province of bolzano|Bolzano/Bozen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dossier on the Metropolitan City of Bologna|url=http://www.affariregionali.it/media/170175/dossier-citt%C3%A0-metropolitana-di-bologna.pdf|publisher=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|Istat]]|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy of Bologna is characterized by a flourishing industrial sector, traditionally centered on the transformation of agricultural and zootechnical products ([[Granarolo]], [[Segafredo Zanetti]], [[Conserve Italia]]), machinery ([[Coesia]], [[IMA (company)|IMA]]), energy ([[Hera Group]]), automotive ([[Ducati]], [[Lamborghini]]), footwear, textile, engineering, chemical, printing and publishing ([[:it:il Mulino|il Mulino]], [[Monrif Group]], [[:it:Zanichelli|Zanichelli]]). 

In particular, Bologna is considered the centre of the so-called &quot;packaging valley&quot;, an area well known for its high concentration of firms specialised in the manufacturing of automatic [[packaging machine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fotis|display-authors=et al|first1=Marco|title=The Automatic Packaging Machinery Sector in Italy and Germany|date=2014|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|isbn=978-3-319-12762-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Bologna is well known for its dense network of [[cooperative]]s, a feature that dates back to the social struggles of farmers and workers in the 1800s and that today produces up to a third of its GDP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duda|first1=John|title=The Italian Region Where Co-ops Produce a Third of Its GDP|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/the-italian-place-where-co-ops-drive-the-economy-and-most-people-are-members-20160705|accessdate=4 November 2017|publisher=[[Yes!

Bologna is home to the [[Guglielmo Marconi International Airport]], the [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|seventh]] busiest Italian airport for passenger traffic (8 million passengers handled in 2017).

[[Bologna Centrale railway station]] is one of Italy's most important train hubs thanks to the city's strategic location as a crossroad between north-south and east-west routes. It serves 58 million passengers annually.&lt;ref name=gs1&gt;{{cite web|title=Bologna Centrale|url=http://www.grandistazioni.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d77f0d935b09a110VgnVCM1000003f16f90aRCRD|publisher=Grandi Stazioni|accessdate=30 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210084923/http://www.grandistazioni.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d77f0d935b09a110VgnVCM1000003f16f90aRCRD|archive-date=10 February 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city hosts several minor railway stations (see [[List of railway stations in Bologna]]).

In addition, Bologna San Donato [[classification yard]], with 33 railway tracks, is the largest freight hub in Italy by size and traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bologna Freight Village |url=http://www.interporto.it/imgup/Company%20profile%202013%20v2.pdf |publisher=Bologna Interporto S.p.a. |accessdate=1 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212140125/http://www.interporto.it/imgup/Company%20profile%202013%20v2.pdf |archivedate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is also served by a large network of public bus lines, including [[Trolleybuses in Bologna|trolleybus lines]], operated since 2012 by [[Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna]] (TPER).

A large [[commuter rail]] service is currently under development (see [[Bologna metropolitan railway service]]), and a four line tram network is also planned (see [[Trams in Bologna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metro-report.com/news/news-by-region/europe/single-view/view/four-tram-lines-planned-for-bologna.html|title=Four tram lines planned for Bologna|website=Metro Report|date=13 March 2019|accessdate=17 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Archiginnasio ora blu Bologna.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Bologna]] is the world's oldest institution of higher learning, founded in AD 1088.]]

The [[University of Bologna]], conventionally said to have been founded in 1088 by [[glossator]]s [[Irnerius]] and [[Pepo (jurist)|Pepo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rashdall|first1=Hastings|title=The universities of Europe in the Middle Ages|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1108018104|pages=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the oldest university in the world. It was an important centre of European intellectual life during the Middle Ages, attracting scholars from Italy and throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ridder-Symoens|first1=editor Hilde de|title=A history of the university in Europe.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521541138|page=12|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Studium, as it was originally known, began as a loosely organized teaching system with each master collecting fees from students on an individual basis. The location of the early University was thus spread throughout the city, with various colleges being founded to support students of a specific nationality.

[[File:Archiginnasio-teatroanatomico.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Anatomical theatre of the Archiginnasio]], dating from 1637.]]

In the Napoleonic era, the headquarters of the university were moved to their present location on [[Via Zamboni]], in the north-eastern sector of the city centre. Today, the University's 11 schools, 33 departments, and 93 libraries are spread across the city and include four subsidiary campuses in nearby [[Cesena]], [[Forlì]], [[Ravenna]], and [[Rimini]]. Noteworthy students present at the university in centuries past included [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]], [[Thomas Becket]], [[Pope Nicholas V]], [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], and [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]. [[Laura Bassi]], appointed in 1732, became the first woman to officially teach at a university in Europe. In more recent history, [[Luigi Galvani]], the discoverer of [[bioelectromagnetics]], and [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the pioneer of radio technology, also worked at the University. The University of Bologna remains one of the most respected and dynamic post-secondary educational institutions in Italy. To this day, Bologna is still very much a university town, with over 80,000 enrolled students in 2015. This community includes a great number of Erasmus, Socrates, and overseas students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE UNIVERSITY TODAY: NUMBERS AND INNOVATION|url=http://www.unibo.it/en/university/who-we-are/university-today|publisher=University of Bologna|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's [[botanical garden]], the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Bologna]], was established in 1568; it is the fourth oldest in Europe.

[[Johns Hopkins University]] maintains its [[The Johns Hopkins University SAIS Bologna Center|Bologna Center]] in the city, which hosts one of the overseas campuses of the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). SAIS Bologna was founded in 1955 as the first campus of a US post-graduate school to open in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibo.it/en/international/agreements-and-networks/american-centres |title=American Centres — University of Bologna |website=Unibo.it |date= |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by Marshall Plan efforts to build a cultural bridge between America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/us/rm/2005/46551.htm |title=Remarks at the 50th Anniversary of SAIS in Bologna |website=2001-2009.state.gov |date=19 May 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Bologna Center also hosts the ''Associazione italo-americana &quot;Luciano Finelli&quot;'', which supports cross-cultural awareness and exchange between Italy and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italo-americana.org/wp/about-us/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121074742/http://www.italo-americana.org/wp/about-us/ |archivedate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Bologna hosts a [[music school]], [[Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini]], established in 1804, and an [[art school]], [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna]], founded in 1802. Both institutions were born as part of the reforms introduced by Napoleon Bonaparte.

Over the centuries, Bologna has acquired many nicknames: &quot;the fat&quot; (''la grassa'') refers to its cuisine, in which the most famous specialities are prepared using rich meats (especially pork), egg pasta and dairy products, such as butter and Parmesan. Another nickname that has been given to the city is &quot;the red&quot; (''la rossa''), which was originally 
used as a reference to the colour of the buildings in the city centre, has later become connected with the communist ideology supported by the majority of the population, in particular after World War II: until the election of a centre-right mayor in 1999, the city was renowned as a bastion of the [[Italian Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The red, the fat, and the learned: The story behind Bologna's curious nicknamess|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170510/bologna-dotta-grassa-rassa-red-fat-learned-studious-travel-italy-vacation|accessdate=4 November 2017|publisher=[[The Local]]|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre-left regained power again in the 2004 mayoral elections, with the election of [[Sergio Cofferati]]. It was one of the first European cities to experiment with the concept of [[free public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csi.ensmp.fr/WebCSI/4S/download_paper/download_paper.php?paper=nahuis_van_lente.pdf |title=Repertoires of Democracy: The Case for Public Transport |accessdate=19 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325224146/http://www.csi.ensmp.fr/WebCSI/4S/download_paper/download_paper.php?paper=nahuis_van_lente.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bologna has also two other nicknames: the first one, &quot;the towered&quot; (''la turrita'') refers to the high number of medieval towers that can be found in the city, even if today only 24 towers are still standing. The second one, &quot;the learned&quot; (''la dotta'') is a reference to its university.

===University===
Bologna university was founded in 1088 and it is considered the oldest university of the Western world. According to the QS University Rankings, Bologna university is the 4th Italian university and the 180th in the world.
The high number of students coming from all over Italy and the world (in Bologna there are several campuses of foreign universities such as Johns Hopkins University, Dickinson College, Indiana University, Brown University, University of California and more) considerably affects the everyday life: if on one hand it contributes to liven up the city centre (an area in which the average age of the residents is very high), and it also helps to promote cultural initiatives, on the other hand it creates public order and garbage problems which are related to the lively nightlife of the university district.

===Entertainment and performing arts===
[[File:Arena del Sole.jpg|thumb|Façade of &quot;Arena del Sole&quot; theatre.]]
The city of Bologna became a [[UNESCO]] City of Music on 26 May 2006. According to UNESCO, &quot;As the first Italian city to be appointed to the Network, Bologna has demonstrated a rich musical tradition that is continuing to evolve as a vibrant factor of contemporary life and creation. It has also shown a strong commitment to promoting music as an important vehicle for inclusion in the fight against racism and in an effort to encourage economic and social development. Fostering a wide range of genres from classical to electronic, jazz, folk and opera, Bologna offers its citizens a musical vitality that deeply infiltrates the city's professional, academic, social and cultural facets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=24544&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713153427/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=24544&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=The Creative Cities Network: UNESCO Culture Sector |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |accessdate=19 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theatre]] was a popular form of entertainment in Bologna until the 16th century. The first public theater was the Teatro alla Scala, active since 1547 in [[Palazzo del Podestà (Bologna)|Palazzo del Podestà]]. An important figure of Italian Bolognese theatre was [[Alfredo Testoni]], the playwright, author of ''[[The Cardinal Lambertini]]'', which has had great theatrical success since 1905, repeated on screen by the Bolognese actor [[Gino Cervi]]. In 1998, the City of Bologna initiated the project &quot;Bologna dei Teatri&quot; (Bologna of the Theatres), an association of the major theatrical facilities in the city. This is a circuit of theatres which offer diverse theatrical opportunities, ranging from Bolognese dialect to contemporary [[dance]], but with a communications strategy and promoting unity. Specifically, the shows on the bill in various theatres participating in the project are advertised weekly through a single poster. Bologna's opera house is the [[Teatro Comunale di Bologna]]. The [[Orchestra Mozart]], whose music director was [[Claudio Abbado]] until his death in 2014, was created in 2004.

Bologna hosts a number of international music, art, dance and film festivals, including Angelica&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa-angelica.com/ |title=Angelica |publisher=Aaa-angelica.com |date= |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bologna'' and ''Contemporanea'' (festivals on contemporary music),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolognacontemporanea.it/ |title=Eventi Arte Contemporanea &amp;#124; Bologna contemporanea |website=Bolognacontemporanea.it |date= |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolognafestival (international classical music festival),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolognafestival.it |title=Bolonafestival |publisher=Bolognafestival.it |date= |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Tagliatelle ragù bolognese 01.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tagliatelle]] al ragù Bolognese'' as served in Bologna.]]
Bologna is renowned for its culinary tradition. It has baptised the famous [[Bolognese sauce]], a meat-based pasta sauce that in Italy is called ''[[ragù]]'' and is substantially different from the variety found worldwide; moreover, in Bologna the sauce is used only as a dressing for [[tagliatelle]], serving it with [[spaghetti]] being considered odd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cesarato|first1=Monica|title=Why you won't find spaghetti bolognese in Italy|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20160914/the-truth-about-spaghetti-bolognese-ragu-pasta|accessdate=5 November 2017|publisher=[[The Local]]|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated in the fertile Po River Valley, the rich local cuisine depends heavily on meats and cheeses.

[[File:Prepartita bologna bari.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The 38,000-capacity [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]] is the home of [[Bologna FC 1909]]]]
A sporting nickname for Bologna is ''Basket City'' in reference to the successes of the town's two rival historic [[basketball]] clubs, [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Fortitudo]] and [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Virtus]], though the clubs are now often referred to by the names of their current sponsors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = Alexander Wolff |title = Big Game, Small World: A Basketball Adventure |year = 2003 |chapter = 6 |publisher = Grand Central Publishing |isbn= 978-0-446-67989-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the two, the latter won 15 [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian basketball championships]] and two [[Euroleague]]s making them one of the most influential European basketball clubs; the former won two league titles between 1999 and 2005.
The rivalry is temporarily dormant since Fortitudo left the country's professional ranks when, following the [[Lega Basket Serie A 2008–09|2008–09 season]], the club was relegated from the top-level [[Lega Basket Serie A|Lega A]] to [[LegADue]], before being relegated further to the nominally amateur Serie A Dilettanti for financial reasons; in the 2012–13 season, [[Fortitudo Bologna|Fortitudo]] will play in the [[LegADue]].
The Italian Basketball League, which operates both Lega A and LegADue, has its headquarters in Bologna.

[[Association Football|Football]] also has a strong tradition in Bologna. 
The city's main club, [[Bologna F.C. 1909]], have won seven Italian league championships (the latest in [[1963-64 Serie A|1963–64]]), which make them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league; in their heyday in the 1930s Bologna FC were called ''&quot;Lo squadrone che tremare il mondo fa&quot;'' (Italian for &quot;The Team that Shakes the World&quot;).
The club play at the 38,000-capacity [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]], which has hosted the Italian national team in both football and [[rugby union]], as well as the [[San Marino national football team]].
It was also a venue at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].

[[Rugby union]] is also present in the city: Rugby Bologna 1928 is not only one of the oldest Italian rugby union clubs but also the first ever club affiliated to the [[Federazione Italiana Rugby|Italian rugby union federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.air.it/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=18003 |title = Rugby Bologna 1928 : quale futuro? |last = Zanasi |first = Gianni |date = 6 March 2009 |website = air.it |publisher = Associazione Italiana Rugbysti |location = |language = Italian |trans-title = What Future for Rugby Bologna 1928? |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141105161150/http://www.air.it/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=18003 |archivedate = 5 November 2014 |accessdate = 5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, to date (2014) is Italy's oldest rugby union club still in operation.
The club took part to the top tier of the Italian championship for the first 25 years of their history never winning the title but getting to the runner-up place several times; they returned in top division (Serie A1 then Super 10), in the late 1990s and faced serious financial problems which led them to the relegation and almost to disappearance.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
