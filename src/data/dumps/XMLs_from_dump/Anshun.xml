As of 2010, it had a population of 2,297,339.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/cn-52.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428071135/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/cn-52.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-28 }} Census 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The city proper had a population of 765,313.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Anshun has a long history dating back to the [[Western Han dynasty]] around 200 B.C. There are two special kinds of culture which existed in this area throughout Chinese history: Tempu and [[Yelang]].

The [[Tianlong Tunbao town]] is close to Anshun city. Tunbao is a town with a long history which includes eight small areas. Each one is connected with each other since it was a main war place from the period of [[Ming Dynasty]]. The culture of [[Tunbao]] is unique and traditional. First, the traditional clothes are special which are designed respectively from head to foot. Second, ‘Nuo’ is a kind of drama which originated in Tunbao. The performers wear masks and hold the stage property for performing. The plots of drama are all from the legends of history. Third, local stone architectures are representative for long history of Tunbao.
 
Close to Anshun there is a large lake called Yelang. It is named after the famous [[Yelang]] Emperor. Yelang Emperor was the largest minority tribe in southeast of China in Western Han Dynasty. It existed for about 300 years since the Warring States. During accession of [[Emperor Cheng of Han]], the last king of Yelang Emperor was killed. Yelang Emperor died out from then on, but the off-springs of Yelang Emperor are still alive now. According to historical records, Yelang Emperor was located along [[Zangke River]], which is now called Beipan River and Nanpan River. Bamboo Worship, Cow Totem, bullfight and dogfight are the typical national culture signals of Yelang Emperor.

Anshun's administrative area spans latitude 25° 21'−26° 38' N and longitude 105° 13'−106° 34' E and contains sizeable areas of [[karst]] formation. It borders [[Guiyang]], the provincial capital, and [[Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture]] to the east, [[Liupanshui]] to the west, [[Qianxinan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture]] to the south, and [[Bijie]] to the north. Within the prefecture, the elevation ranges from {{convert|1102|to|1694|m|ft}}.

Anshun has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') bordering on a [[subtropical highland climate]] (Köppen ''Cwb''), tempered by its rather high altitude and having frequent rain (falling on just over half of the days of the year) and high humidity year-round. Winters are short, cool and damp, while summers are very warm. The monthly 24-hour mean temperature ranges from {{convert|4.5|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|22.0|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|14.22|°C|1}}.
