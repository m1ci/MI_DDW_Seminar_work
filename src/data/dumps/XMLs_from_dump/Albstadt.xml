'''Albstadt''' ({{IPA-de|ˈalpʃtat|-|Albstadt.ogg}}) is the largest city in the [[districts of Germany|district]] of [[Zollernalbkreis]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. It is located on the [[Swabian Jura|Swabian '' Alb'']] mountains, about halfway between [[Stuttgart]] and [[Lake of Constance]].

== Geography ==
Albstadt is spread across a variety of hills and valleys, its elevation ranges between {{convert|614|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level and {{convert|966|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. One valley is the river [[Schmiecha]], a left-hand tributary of the [[Danube]], a second valley is the river of upper [[Eyach (Neckar)|Eyach]], a tributary of the [[Neckar]].

To Albstadt belongs also the [[Raichberg]] hill in the north, on which there is the [[Raichberg Transmitter]] and an observation tower located. South of Albstadt is the [[Heuberg Training Area|Heuberg Military Training Area]].

== History ==
Settlement in the region dates back to at least the [[Iron Age]]. A [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] cemetery in Albstadt was excavated by amateur archaeologists in the late nineteenth century and revealed a wide range of pottery and metal artefacts. Known as the 'Degerfeld Barrow' [[cemetery]], a substantial collection was built up by the local antiquary Hyronimus Edelmann that was eventually deposited in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.albstadt-ein-apotheker-geht-auf-schatzsuche.f1c6f53e-331a-4949-8e70-8e3f6a51d0ee.html Schwarzwaelder-bote website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Degerfeld British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mining ==

In former times iron ore was produced in Albstadt.  Fidel Eppler was the name of the mine-inspector. The buttress wood was bought in  Truchtelfingen and used from Lautlinger Knappen at the Hörnle area .&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Hermann Bitzer|editor-surname1= Hermann Bitzer Studienrat Rosenfeld †1964|title=Tailfinger Heimatbuch 1954|page=35|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an old 3,5&amp;nbsp;km mine in a Doggererzflöz in [[Rietheim-Weilheim|Weilheim]] is wood in the Tuttlinger Fruchtkasten .&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludwigsthal&quot;&gt;Fruchtkasten: ''[https://www.tuttlingen.de/de/Die-Stadt/Tuttlingen-aktuell/Pressemitteilungen/Pressemitteilung?view=publish&amp;item=article&amp;id=6581https://www.tuttlingen.de/de/Die-Stadt/Tuttlingen-aktuell/Pressemitteilungen/Pressemitteilung?view=publish&amp;item=article&amp;id=6581 Abteilung Ludwigsthal].'' In: ''Pressemiteilungen.'' 21.November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Steel was produced in [[Tuttlingen]] by the Schwäbische Hüttenwerke in Ludwigstal, today iron brakes.

The districts Ebingen, Laufen, Lautlingen, Pfeffingen und Tailfingen were first mentioned in 793 in a document of the abbey St. Gallen. [[Ebingen]] received city rights around 1250 from the [[House of Hohenberg|Hohenberg]] ducal family.

Albstadt consists of the following urban districts, which had been independent towns and merged to form Albstadt in 1975:
