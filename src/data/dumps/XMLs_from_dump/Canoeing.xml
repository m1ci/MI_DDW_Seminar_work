'''Canoeing''' is an activity which involves [[paddling]] a [[canoe]] with a single-bladed [[paddle]]. Common meanings of the term are limited to when the canoeing is the central purpose of the activity. Broader meanings include when it is combined with other activities such as canoe camping, or where canoeing is merely a transportation method used to accomplish other activities. Most present-day canoeing is done as or as a part of a sport or recreational activity. In some parts of Europe canoeing refers to both canoeing and [[kayaking]], with a canoe being called an ''open canoe''.

A few of the recreational forms of canoeing are [[canoe camping]] and canoe racing.  Other forms include a wide range of canoeing on lakes, rivers, oceans, ponds and streams.

== History of organized recreational canoeing ==

Canoeing is an ancient mode of transportation.  Modern recreational canoeing was established in the late 19th century. In 1924, canoeing associations from Austria, Germany, Denmark and Sweden founded the ''Internationalen Representation for Kanusport'', forerunner of the [[International Canoe Federation]]. Canoeing became part of the [[Olympic Games]] in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|summer of 1936]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canoe/Kayak Sprint Equipment and History|url=http://www.olympic.org/canoe-kayak-sprint-equipment-and-history?tab=history|website=Olympic.org|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/sports/rio-2016-olympics/know-your-sport-canoeing-2951642/ |title=Rio 2016 Olympics: Know your sport — Canoeing |publisher=indianexpress.com |date= |accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main form of competitive sport was [[canoe sprint]] using a [[sprint canoe]]. Others include [[canoe polo]], [[whitewater canoeing]], [[canoe marathon]], [[ICF canoe marathon]], and [[playboating]].

National canoe associations include the [[American Canoe Association|American]], [[Canadian Canoe Association|Canadian]], [[British Canoe Union|British]], [[Scottish Canoe Association|Scottish]], and [[Welsh Canoe Association|Welsh]].

==Recreational canoeing==

Most present-day canoeing is done as or as a part of a sport or recreational activity. In some parts of Europe canoeing refers to both canoeing and [[kayaking]], with a canoe being called an ''Open canoe''.  A few of the recreational forms of canoeing are [[canoe camping]] and canoe racing such as [[canoe sprint]] and [[Canoe marathon|canoe marathons]].  Other forms include a wide range of canoeing on lakes, rivers, oceans, ponds and streams.  

The summer Olympics include [[Canoeing at the Summer Olympics|canoeing competitions]]. [[Canoe slalom]] (previously known as whitewater slalom) is a competitive sport with the aim to navigate a decked canoe or kayak through a course of hanging downstream or upstream gates on river rapids in the fastest time possible. It is one of the two kayak and canoeing disciplines at the Summer Olympics, and is referred to by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as Canoe/Kayak Slalom. The other Olympic canoeing discipline is canoe sprint.
