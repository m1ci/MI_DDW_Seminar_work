'''NurMahal''' or Noor Mahal ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]:  [[Gurmukhī script|ਨੂਰਮਹਿਲ]]) is a city and a [[municipal council]] in [[Jalandhar district]] in the State of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. It is a small town located near the Lohian Khas-[[Nakodar]] - [[Ludhiana]] line in Punjab. This town is also connected with the nearby towns of [[Phillaur]] and [[Nakodar]] by a road going along the railway lines. Nurmahal is situated 13&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nakodar]], 33&amp;nbsp;km from Jalandhar.
Many villages are close by to Nurmahal.

== History ==
Nurmahal was built on a place where an ancient town, called '''Kot Kahlur''', was located which was proven by the bricks and many coins found beneath the soil of this town. It is believed that the ancient city was abandoned or destroyed around 1300 for an unknown reason.

Nurmahal is named after [[Nur Jehan|Noor Jahan]], the wife of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Jahangir]] (1605–1627) as she was brought up here, and is thought to have spent her childhood here. The town then came under the rule of Talwan Rajputs and [[Ranghar]]s before the East India Company gained control.

== Sarai Nurmahal ==

{{main|Serai Nurmahal}}
Major point of tourist interest in Nurmahal is the [[Serai Nurmahal|Mughal Serai]] constructed by Noor Jahan. It is a striking example of oriental architecture. This historical monument is looked after by the Archaeological Department. The whole structure of the sarai is in the form of quadrangle consisting of 140 cells, spread over the four sides of the structure.

The best way to reach Serai Nurmahal is to go to Nakodar Junction, which is the nearest railway station. The junction is served by the Northern Railways.
