'''Balaklava''' ({{lang-uk|Балаклáва}}, {{lang-ru|Балаклáва}}, {{lang-crh|Balıqlava}}, {{lang-gr|Σύμβολον}}) is a settlement on the [[Crimean Peninsula]] and part of the [[city]] of [[Sevastopol]]. It is an administrative center of Balaklava Raion that used to be part of the [[Crimean Oblast]] before it was transferred to Sevastopol Municipality. Population: {{Crimea-census2014|18,649|punct=.}}
==History==

Balaklava has changed possession several times during its history. A settlement at its present location was founded under the name of Symbolon (Σύμβολον) by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], for whom it was an important [[commerce|commercial]] city.

During the [[Middle Ages]], it was controlled by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and then by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] who conquered it in 1365. The Byzantines called the town Yamboli and the Genoese named it Cembalo. The Genoese built a large trading empire in both the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Black Sea]], buying [[slavery|slaves]] in [[Eastern Europe]] and shipping them to [[Egypt]] via the Crimea, a lucrative market hotly contested with by the [[Republic of Venezia|Venetians]].

The ruins of a [[Genoa|Genoese]] fortress positioned high on a clifftop above the entrance to the Balaklava Inlet are a popular [[tourism|tourist]] attraction and have recently become the stage for a Medieval festival. The fortress is a subject of [[Mickiewicz]]'s penultimate poem in his 1826 cycle of ''[[Crimean Sonnets]]''.

In 1475 Cembalo City was conquered by Turks and they rename it to ''Balyk-Yuva'' (Fish's Nest) which subsequently became Balaklava.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei R. Grinevetsky, et. al. ” The Black Sea Encyclopedia”, Springer,  2014: 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]], the Russian troops invaded Crimea in 1771. Thirteen years later, Crimea was definitively annexed by the [[Russian Empire]]. After that, Crimean Tatar and Turkish population was forcefully replaced by Greek Orthodox people from the [[Archipelago]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
  
In 1787 the city was visited by [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Some rural communities surrounding Balaklava remained populated by Crimean Tatars until their deportation in 1944.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town became famous for the [[Battle of Balaclava]] during the [[Crimean War]] thanks to the suicidal [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], a British [[cavalry]] charge due to a misunderstanding sent up a valley strongly held on three sides by the Russians, in which about 250 men were killed or wounded, and over 400 horses lost, effectively reducing the size of the mounted brigade by two thirds and destroying some of the finest light cavalry in the world to no military purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Brighton|Brighton, Terry]], ''Hell Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade''. London: Penguin, 2005. New York: Henry Holt, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The British poet [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] immortalized the battle in verse in his [[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|''Charge of the Light Brigade'']].

The [[balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]], a tight knitted garment covering the whole head and neck with holes for the eyes and mouth, also takes its name from this settlement, where soldiers first wore them. Also numerous towns founded in English-speaking countries in later parts of the 19th Century were named &quot;Balaklava&quot; (see [[Balaklava (disambiguation)]]).

During the [[Second World War]], Balaklava was the southernmost point in the Soviet-German lines.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1954 Balaklava, together with the whole [[Crimea]], [[1954 transfer of Crimea|passed from Russia to Ukraine]]. In 1957 it was formally incorporated into the municipal borders of Sevastopol by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government and lost city status. It became part of the independent state of [[Ukraine]] in 1991. Today there are over 50 monuments in the town dedicated to the remembrance of military valour in past wars, including the [[Great Patriotic War]], the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Russian Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Since [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|internationally unrecognised]] 2014 [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] Balaklava, along with rest of Crimea, is administered by Russia. In 2019 Russian authorities granted Balaklava status of a city within Sevastopol&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://an-crimea.ru/page/news/178768 |title=Аргументы Недели.

==Underground submarine base==
One of the monuments is an underground, formerly classified [[submarine base]] that was operational until 1993. The base was said to be virtually indestructible and designed to survive a direct [[Nuclear weapon|atomic]] impact. During that period, Balaklava was one of the most secret residential areas in the Soviet Union. Almost the entire population of Balaklava at one time worked at the base; even family members could not visit the town of Balaklava without a good reason and proper identification. The base remained operational after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 until 1993 when the decommissioning process started. This process saw the removal of the warheads and low-yield torpedoes. In 1996, the last Russian submarine left the base. The base has since been opened to the public as the [[Naval museum complex Balaklava]].
