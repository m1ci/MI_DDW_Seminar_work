'''Bageis''' ({{lang-grc|Βάγεις}}), '''Bagis''' (Βάγις), or '''Bage''' (Βάγη) was a city in the Roman province of [[Lydia]] in [[Asia Minor]] (modern [[Turkey]]).

== Name ==
The name of the city appears in the form ''Bageis'' (in the genitive plural case of the name of its inhabitants, ΒΑΓΝΩΝ or ΒΑΓΗΝΩΝ) on its coins, but ''Bagis'' is the form given in the ''[[Synecdemos]]'' of [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]], and ''Bage'' in later ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]''.&lt;ref name=Janin/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; Some of its coins add the additional name of KAISAREΩN apparently denoting the additional city name of Caesarea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/lydia/bagis/i.htm Wildwinds.com - Ancient coins from Bageis]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Inscriptions uncovered by Keppel place the ancient town near [[Sirghe]] on the left (south) side of the [[Hermos River]].&lt;ref name=Janin/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; Modern scholars pinpoint a site at [[Güre, Uşak|Güre]].&lt;ref name=Barrington&gt;{{Cite Barrington|62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DARE|21274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical history==

The episcopal [[Episcopal see|see]] of Bagis, being in the [[Roman province]] of [[Lydia]] was a [[suffragan]] of [[Sardis]], the capital of the province.

The acts of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) mention a Pollio as bishop of Baris in that province. Since there is no evidence of a [[bishopric]] of that name, Janin (1931),&lt;ref name=Janin&gt;Raymond Janin, v. ''Bagé'', in [http://booksnow.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca2/4/dictionnairedhis06bauduoft/dictionnairedhis06bauduoft.pdf ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol. VI, 1932, col. 201&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Adolf von Harnack]],&lt;ref&gt;Harnack, ''Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten'', p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; consider &quot;Baris&quot; to be an error for &quot;Bagis&quot;, while Pétrirdès (1907), who cites [[Heinrich Gelzer]] and [[C. H. Turner]], does not accept that correction.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02203a.htm Sophrone Pétridès, &quot;Bageis&quot; in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1907)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other known bishops of Bagis are Chrysapius or Chrysanthus, who was at the [[Robber Council of Ephesus]] in 449, Leonides, who was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of Lydia sent in 459 to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] with regard to the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]], and Basilius and Clemens, who were at the [[Council of Constantinople (879)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02203a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; presumably one of them ordained by [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]], the other by [[Photius]].&lt;ref name=Janin/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

Bagis must have disappeared as a residential see during the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Byzantine]] wars, perhaps in the 12th century, although it continued to be listed in ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]''.&lt;ref name=Janin/&gt;

No longer a residential bishopric, Bagis is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 845&lt;/ref&gt; a list of [[titular see|titular bishops]] includes:
*St. [[Francesco Antonio Domenico Fogolla]], (28 Jun 1898 Appointed - 9 Jul 1900) 
*Joaquim Silvério de Souza † (16 Nov 1901 Appointed - 17 May 1905)[[Bishop of Diamantina]].
