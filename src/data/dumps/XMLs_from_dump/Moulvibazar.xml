==History==
[[File:Moulvibazar Govt. High School Auditorium.jpg|thumb|Saifur Rahman Auditorium]]
In 1771, [[Moulvi Syed Qudratullah]] established a bazaar near the banks of the [[Manu River, Tripura|Manu River]] using his [[zamindar]]i land. He started importing edible goods, such as fruits and vegetables opening up opportunities for people to purchase as well as sell. The location allowed easy access through river and land transport. The bazaar became the headquarters of South Sylhet subdivision in 1882. The anti-British [[Khilafat Movement]] in 1921 also spread to Moulvibazar and campaigners that were present included [[Chittaranjan Das]], [[Hussain Ahmed Madani]] and [[Sarojini Naidu]]. In 1932, the [[Ali Amzad Government Girls' High School]] was opened as a public school.

During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] and [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], the [[Pakistan Army]] moved its the 313rd Brigade from [[Sylhet]] to Moulvibazar and a battalion from the 313rd was kept at Sylhet to form the nucleus of the 202nd ''ad hoc'' Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp126&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December, a number of people were killed and wounded by mine explosions at the premises of the Moulvibazar Government High School.
