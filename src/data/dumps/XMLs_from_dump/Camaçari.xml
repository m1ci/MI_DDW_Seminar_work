'''Camaçari''' is a city in [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. It is located at {{Coord|12|41|51|S|38|19|27|W}}. It is part of the [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] Metropolitan Region (''Região Metropolitana de Salvador''), being the industrial city of the metropolis. Camaçari covers {{convert|784.658|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and had an estimated population of 292,074 in 2014, with a population density of 370 per square kilometer. The municipality consists of three districts: Camaçari, Abrantes, and Monte Gordo.&lt;ref name=&quot;i&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The area of Camaçari was inhabited by [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] ethnic group prior to the arrival of the Portuguese. The first Portuguese settlement was in 1558 by two Jesuit priests, João Gonçalves and Antônio Rodrigues.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&quot;/&gt; They formed a village called Aldeia do Divino Espírito Santo. Aldeia do Divino Espírito Santo played an important role in the expulsion of the Dutch who arrived in Bahia in the 17th century. Troops under the leadership of bishop D. Mark Teixeira drove out the Dutch in 1624. The name of the village was changed to Vila de Nova Abrantes do Espírito Santo on September 28, 1758 under orders from the Marquiq de Pombal. The Jesuits were also expelled from the area at the same time. Later the village came to be known simply as Vila de Abrantes.&lt;ref name=&quot;i&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
Several factories and petrochemical plants compose one of the largest industrial areas in [[Brazil]] and the largest of the Northeast region of the country. The Brazilian multinational company [[Braskem]], the largest petrochemical company in the Americas by production capacity, owns a major petrochemical complex in Camaçari. It is the largest in Brazil, along with that of [[Novo Triunfo|Triunfo]], which is also owned by [[Braskem]]. The city is also home to a large [[automobile]] factory owned by the [[Ford Motor Company]].
