Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the [[Persian Empire]] in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian]] eras for over eight hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.freersackler.si.edu/events/films/?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D128600412|title=Ctesiphon: An Ancient Royal Capital in Context |last=|first= |date= September 15, 2018|work=Smithsonian |accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ctesiphon remained the capital of the Sasanian Empire until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in 651 AD.

Ctesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of [[Seleucia]]. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;The Cities&quot; ([[Aramaic]]: ''Mahuza'', {{lang-ar|المدائن}}, ''[[al-Mada'in]]''). In the late sixth and early seventh century, it was one of the [[largest cities throughout history|largest cities in the world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|title=Largest Cities Through History|publisher=geography.about.com|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman–Parthian Wars]], Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell twice during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Battle of Ctesiphon in 363]] AD. After the Muslim invasion the city fell into decay and was depopulated by the end of the eighth century, its place as a political and economic center taken by the [[Abbasid]] capital at [[Baghdad]]. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the [[Taq Kasra]], sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.&lt;ref&gt;''Eventually no less than four Sasanian rulers were quoted as its builders: Shapur I (241–273), Shapur II (310–379), Chosroes I Anushirvan (531–579) and Chosroes II Parvez (590–628).'' {{Cite journal|author=Kurz, Otto|year=1941|title=The Date of the Ṭāq i Kisrā|journal=[[The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] | series =  (New Series)|volume=73|number=1|pages=37–41|jstor= 25221709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
The Latin name ''{{lang|la|Ctesiphon}}'' derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ''{{transl|grc|Ktēsiphôn}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:Κτησιφῶν|Κτησιφῶν]]}}). This is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as ''Tisfōn'' or ''Tisbōn''.&lt;ref&gt;''E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936'', Vol. 2 (Brill, 1987: {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as ''tyspwn'', which can be read as ''Tīsfōn'', ''Tēsifōn'', etc. in [[Manichean alphabet|Manichaean]] [[Parthian language|Parthian]] 𐫤𐫏𐫘𐫛𐫇𐫗, in [[Middle Persian]] 𐭲𐭩𐭮𐭯𐭥𐭭 and in Christian [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] (in [[Syriac alphabet]]) languages. The [[New Persian]] form is ''Tisfun'' ({{lang|fa|تیسفون}}).

Texts from the [[Church of the East]]'s synods referred to the city as ''{{transl|syc|Qṭēspōn}}'' ({{lang-syr|ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ}}) or some times ''{{transl|syc|Māḥôzē}}'' ({{lang-syr|ܡܚܘܙ̈ܐ}}) when referring to the metropolis of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]].

In modern Arabic, the name is usually ''Ṭaysafūn'' ({{lang|ar|طيسفون}}) or ''Qaṭaysfūn'' ({{lang|ar|قطيسفون}}) or as ''al-Mada'in'' ({{lang|ar|المدائن}} &quot;The Cities&quot;, referring to Greater Ctesiphon). &quot;According to [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt]] [...], quoting Ḥamza, the original form was Ṭūsfūn or Tūsfūn, which was arabicized as Ṭaysafūn.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Kröger|first=Jens|chapter=Ctesiphon|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=6|year=1993|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f4/v6f4a030.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116013710/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f4/v6f4a030.html|archivedate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian name of the city was ''Tizbon'' ({{lang|hy|[[wikt:Տիզբոն|Տիզբոն]]}}). Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the [[Book of Ezra]]&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 8:17&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Old Testament]] as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name, [[Cas (people)|Cas]], and a cognate of [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Qazvin]]). It is also mentioned in the [[Talmud]] as Aktisfon &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Talmud Bavli Tractate Gittin|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6A}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Location ==
[[Image:ctesiphon-ruin 1864.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Taq Kasra]] or Ctesiphon palace ruin, with the arch in the centre, 1864]]
Ctesiphon is located approximately at [[Al-Mada'in]], {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the modern city of [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial [[Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[Taq Kasra|archway of Chosroes]] (''Taq Kasra'') was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 240).&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of [[Salman Pak]].

== History ==

===Parthian period===
Ctesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by [[Mithridates I of Parthia]]. The reign of [[Gotarzes I]] saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire's capital circa 58&amp;nbsp;BC during the reign of [[Orodes II]]. Gradually, the city merged with the old [[Hellenistic]] capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh, K. 2007 p. 125&quot;&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Mithradatkirt]], and [[Hecatompylos]] at [[Hyrcania]]) to the [[Scythian]] incursions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh, K. 2007 p. 125&quot;/&gt;

[[Strabo]] abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times [[Babylon]] was the metropolis of [[Assyria]]; but now [[Seleucia]] is the metropolis, I mean the [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], as it is called. Nearby is situated a village called Ctesiphon, a large village. This village the kings of the Parthians were wont to make their winter residence, thus sparing the Seleucians, in order that the Seleucians might not be oppressed by having the [[Scythians|Scythian]] folk or soldiery quartered amongst them. Because of the Parthian power, therefore, Ctesiphon is a city rather than a village; its size is such that it lodges a great number of people, and it has been equipped with buildings by the Parthians themselves; and it has been provided by the Parthians with wares for sale and with the arts that are pleasing to the Parthians; for the Parthian kings are accustomed to spend the winter there because of the salubrity of the air, but they summer at [[Ecbatana]] and in [[Hyrcania]] because of the prevalence of their ancient renown.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16A*.html |title=LacusCurtius • Strabo's Geography — Book XVI Chapter 1, 16 |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the [[Roman Empire]] in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome five times in its history – three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor [[Trajan]] captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, [[Hadrian]], decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general [[Avidius Cassius]] captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.

===Sasanian period===
[[File:Southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] [[Mesopotamia]] and its surroundings.]]
By 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the [[Sasanian Empire]], who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as [[al-Mada'in]], and in [[Aramaic]] as Mahoze.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in Islamic [[Arabic]] sources is called &quot;the Old City&quot; ({{lang|ar|مدينة العتيقة}} ''Madīnah al-'Atīqah''), where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace ({{lang|ar|قصر الأبيض}}), was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Asbānbar or Aspānbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths. [[Taq Kasra]] was located in the latter.{{sfn|Morony|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Houtsma |first1=M. Th |title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936 |date=1993 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004097919 |page=76a |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The western side was known as [[Veh-Ardashir]] (meaning &quot;the good city of Ardashir&quot; in [[Middle Persian]]), known as Mahoza by the [[Jews]], Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Nestorian patriarch]]. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was [[Valashabad]].{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Ctesiphon had several other districts which were named Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.{{sfn|Morony|2009}}

[[Severus Alexander]] advanced towards Ctesiphon in 233, but as corroborated by [[Herodian]], his armies suffered a humiliating defeat against [[Ardashir I]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 185).&lt;/ref&gt; In 283, emperor [[Carus]] sacked the city uncontested during a period of civil upheaval. In 295, emperor [[Galerius]] was defeated outside the city. However, he returned a year later with a vengeance and won a victory which ended in the fifth and final capture of the city by the Romans in 299. He returned it to the Persian king [[Narseh of Persia|Narses]] in exchange for [[Armenia]] and western Mesopotamia. In c. 325 and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Babylon&amp;Seleuicia1(Peutinger Map).png|thumb|left|4th century Ctesiphon ([[Peutinger Map]])]]

After the conquest of Antioch in 541, [[Khosrau I]] built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city ''[[Weh Antiok Khusrau]]'', or literally, &quot;better than Antioch Khosrau built this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dingas, Winter 2007, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Local inhabitants of the area called the new city ''Rumagan'', meaning &quot;town of the Romans&quot; and Arabs called the city ''al-Rumiyya''. Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrau built a number of fortified cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;frye&quot;&gt;Frye 1993, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Khosrau I deported 292,000 citizens, slaves, and conquered people to this new city in 542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christensen |first= |title=The Decline of Iranshahr: Irrigation and Environments in the History of the Middle East, 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500 |location=Copenhagen |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |year=1993 |isbn=87-7289-259-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 590, a member of the [[House of Mihran]], [[Bahram Chobin]] repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler [[Khosrau II]] from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrau II, with aid from the [[Byzantine Empire]], reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrau's new winter residence, [[Dastagerd]].{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}} In 627, the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms. In 628, a deadly plague hit Ctesiphon, al-Mada'in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrau's son and successor, [[Kavadh II]].{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}}

In 629, Ctesiphon was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper [[Shahrbaraz]], but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrau II's daughter [[Borandukht]]. Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the [[House of Ispahbudhan]] and the Parsig (Persian) faction under [[Piruz Khosrow]]. {{also|Sasanian interregnum}}

===Downfall of the Sasanians and the Islamic conquests===
{{see| Siege of Ctesiphon (637)}}

In the mid-630s, the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim Arabs]], who had invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]].{{sfn|Morony|2009}} The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|early 637]].

The Muslim military officer [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]] quickly seized [[Valashabad]] and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of [[Weh Antiok Khusrau]] and [[Veh-Ardashir]]. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Weh Antiok Khusrau were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (''[[jizya]]''). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the [[Sasanian family tree|Sasanian royal family]], [[nobility|nobles]], and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Furthermore, the throne hall in [[Taq Kasra]] was briefly used as a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Dr Julian (1999). Scarre, Chris, ed. The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient world The Great Monuments and How they were Built. Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 185–186. {{ISBN|0-500-05096-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the [[Abbasid]] capital at [[Baghdad]] in the 8th century, and soon became a [[ghost town]]. [[al-Mansur|Caliph Al-Mansur]] took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast.&lt;ref&gt;Bier, L. (1993). The Sassanian Palaces and their Influence in Early Islam. In Ars Orientalis, 23, 62-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur also used the [[al-Rumiya]] town as the Abbasid capital city for a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |title=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland |date=1895 |publisher=Cambridge University Press for the Royal Asiatic Society |page=40 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed to be the basis for the city of [[Isbanir]] in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

===Modern era===
The ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|a major battle of World War I]] in November 1915. The [[Ottoman Empire]] defeated troops of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some {{convert|40|mi|km}} before [[siege of Kut|trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender]].

== Population and religion ==
Under Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included [[Arameans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch [[Mar Babai I]], fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the [[Merv]] metropolis as pivot. The population also included [[Manicheans]], a Dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during [[Umayyad]] rule fixing their 'patriarchate of Babylon' there.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|the Arab capture of the metropolis]]. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided [[Ali]] with presents, which he, however, refused to take. {{sfn|Morony|2009}} In the ninth century, the surviving Manicheans fled and displaced their patriarchate up the Silk road, in [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;John van Schaik, ''Ketters. Een geschiedenis van de Kerk'', Leuven, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
A [[Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] led by Oscar Reuther excavated at Ctesiphon in 1928–29 mainly at Qasr bint al-Qadi on the western part of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K. |last=Schippmann |chapter=Ktesiphon-Expedition im Winter 1928/29 |title=Grundzüge der parthischen Geschichte |location=Darmstadt |publisher= |year=1980 |isbn=3-534-07064-X |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. |last=Meyer |title=Seleukia und Ktesiphon |journal=Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft zu Berlin |volume=67 |pages=1–26 |year=1929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Reuther |authorlink=Oscar Reuther |title=The German Excavations at Ctesiphon |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=434–451 |year=1929 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00003781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Upton |title=The Expedition to Ctesiphon 1931–1932 |journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art |volume=27 |issue= |pages=188–197 |year=1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter of 1931–1932 a joint expedition of the German State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art continued excavations at the site, focusing on the areas of Ma'aridh, Tell Dheheb, the Taq-i Kisra, Selman Pak and Umm ez-Za'tir under the direction of Ernst Kühnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ctes/hd_ctes.htm Fowlkes-Childs, Blair. “Ctesiphon.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, an Italian team from the [[University of Turin]] directed by [[Antonio Invernizzi]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Giorgio Gullini|it}} worked at the site, which they identified not as Ctesiphon but as Veh Ardashir.
