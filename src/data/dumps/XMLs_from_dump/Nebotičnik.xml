The Nebotičnik building, originally designed as an eight-storey structure,&lt;ref name=&quot;hotelmons&quot; /&gt; was designed by Vladimir Šubic, with assistance from [[Ladislav Kham]], [[Ivo Medved]] ([[pavilion]] on the terrace), [[Marjan Mušič]] ([[tempietto]] on top), [[Marjan Sever]], and [[Bojan Stupica]] (fittings of the cafe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mojdom.dnevnik.si/sl/Arhitektura/750/Vrh+ljubljanskega+Neboti%C4%8Dnika+spet+v+starem+sijaju |title=Vrh ljubljanskega Nebotičnika spet v starem sijaju |date=24 September 2010 |newspaper=Mojdom.Dnevnik.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was decorated with sculptures by [[Lojze Dolinar]] (the female figure on the side façade in the height of the sixth floor), [[Boris Kalin]] (the relief above the main entrance), and [[France Gorše]] (four bronze heads in the main hall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ppmol.org/urbanizem5/kliping/4001258-prenova-neboticnika.pdf |title=Fantastičen pogled na vse strani mesta |language=Slovenian |trans-title=A Fantastic Look on All Sides of the City |date=27 July 2010 |newspaper=Delo |page=18 |first=Jožica |last=Grgič |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065519/http://ppmol.org/urbanizem5/kliping/4001258-prenova-neboticnika.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its design is based on the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and [[art-deco]] styles, and is crowned with [[pilasters]] on the upper floors. Its design follows the classical tripartite division of tall buildings pioneered by the American architect [[Louis Sullivan]]&amp;mdash;it is composed of a base designed to interact with the street and pedestrians, a homogeneous shaft, and a crown, topped by a [[cylindrical]] [[colonnade]] with a mounted [[Flag#Flagpoles|flag pole]],&lt;ref name=&quot;govcomm&quot; /&gt; which was added after the completion of the tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;sl.info&quot;&gt;[http://www.slovenia.info/?arhitekturne_znamenitosti=2154&amp;bigfont=1&amp;rnd=0.5459989295410987 Slovenia.info - Architectural heritage - Ljubljana, Nebotičnik Skyscraper]. Retrieved 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[façade]] is interrupted by evenly distributed rectangular [[window]]s framed in stone, an accentuated ground level and first floor, and semi-circular windows in the café on the eleventh storey.

The entrance on the ground floor leads to a [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] lined with [[Karst Plateau|Karst]] [[marble]]. Upper storeys are accessible by elevator or the [[Stairway#Spiral and helical stairs|spiral stairway]] at the centre of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;stair&quot;&gt;''[http://www.world66.com/europe/slovenia/ljubljana/sights world66.com - Ljubljana Sights]'' mentions staircase.

Retrieved on 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the elevators are fast and lead visitors to the café on the upper floors, while the third is slower and leads to the residential levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;govcomm&quot; /&gt; The stairway terminates at the tenth floor.

The façade is adorned by a four-metre (13&amp;nbsp;foot) tall sculpture of a woman, the work of the Slovenian sculptor [[Lojze Dolinar]], to help alleviate the connection between the tower and the lower bank next to the tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;govcomm&quot; /&gt; Sculptures in the [[loggia]] were designed by the Slovenian sculptor [[France Gorše]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sl.info&quot; /&gt; Located to the west of the Nebotičnik building is a six-storey residential structure, designed by the same architect.

== Construction ==
Construction of the Nebotičnik building, ordered by the [[Pension Institute]], was controversial. Being the first building to surpass the [[Baroque]] [[silhouette]] of city's [[bell tower]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;sl.info&quot; /&gt; some residents of Ljubljana feared it would spoil the [[skyline]], and labelled the building a &quot;freak&quot;. The building is located on the site of a [[medieval]] [[monastery]], and while preparing its foundation, contractors came across a 13th-century [[Water well|well]]. A verse by [[Oton Župančič]] was inscribed in the foundation stone at the beginning of its construction in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bukovec2011&quot; /&gt; The statics were calculated by the engineer [[Stanko Dimnik]], who was also the responsible engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |work=Encyclopedia of Slovenia |page=163 |title=Šubic, Vladimir |year=1999 |publisher=Mladinska knjiga |isbn=9788611153643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://nl.ijs.si/fedora/get/sbl:3663/VIEW/ |title=Šubic Vladimir |encyclopedia=Slovenski biografski leksikon |editors=Vide Ogrin, Petra (electronic ed.).

The building was constructed with [[reinforced concrete]], and features many technological elements which were innovative at the time. It has [[central heating]] by automatic [[fuel oil]] burners, and water is supplied to the top seven floors by automatic pumps. The café has pressure ventilation, and hot water is supplied from the basement.&lt;ref name=&quot;recsloarc&quot; /&gt;

The strictest in Japanese anti-seismic criteria was followed in the design of the building, therefore it is supported by 16 [[piling]]s each extending {{convert|18|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} into the ground. This makes the Nebotičnik building one of the most [[earthquake]]-safe in Ljubljana.&lt;ref name=&quot;govcomm&quot; /&gt;
