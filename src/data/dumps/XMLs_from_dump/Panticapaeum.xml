'''Panticapaeum''' ({{lang-grc|Παντικάπαιον|Padikápeon}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city on the eastern shore of [[Crimea]], which the Greeks called [[Taurica]]. The city was built on [[Mount Mithridat]], a hill on the western side of the [[Strait of Kerch|Cimmerian Bosporus]]. It was [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|founded]] by [[Miletus|Milesians]] in the late 7th or early 6th century BC. The ruins of the site are now located in the modern city [[Kerch]].

==Early existence==

During the first centuries of the city's existence, imported Greek articles predominated: [[pottery]] (see [[Kerch Style]]), [[terracotta]]s, and metal objects, probably from workshops in [[Rhodes]], [[Corinth]], [[Samos]], and [[Athens]]. Local production, imitated from the models, was carried on at the same time. Athens manufactured a special type of bowl for the city, known as [[Kerch]] ware. Local potters imitated the [[Hellenistic]] bowls known as the [[Gnathia]] style as well as relief wares—[[Megara|Megarian]] bowls. The city minted silver coins from the 5th century BC and gold and bronze coins from the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Sear, David R. (1978). ''Greek Coins and Their Values ''.

==Fifth to first centuries BC==
In the 5th–4th centuries BC, the city became the residence first of the [[Archaeanactids]] and then of the [[Spartocids]], dynasties of [[Thracian]] kings of [[Bosporan Kingdom|Bosporus]], and was hence itself sometimes called Bosporus. Its economic decline in the 4th–3rd centuries BC was the result of the [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] conquest of the steppes and the growing competition of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] grain.

===Mithridates===

The last of the [[Spartocids]], [[Paerisades V]], apparently left his realm to [[Mithridates VI]] Eupator, king of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]]. This transition was arranged by one of Mithridates's generals, [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]], who earlier had been sent to Taurica to help local Greek cities against [[Palacus]] of [[Lesser Scythia]]. The mission did not go smoothly: Paerisades was murdered by [[Scythians]] led by [[Saumacus]], and Diophantus escaped to return later with reinforcements to suppress the revolt (c. 110&amp;nbsp;BC).

Half of a century later, Mithridates took his life in Panticapaeum, when, after his defeat in a [[Third Mithridatic War|war]] against [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], his son and heir [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnaces]] and citizens of Panticapaeum turned against him.
