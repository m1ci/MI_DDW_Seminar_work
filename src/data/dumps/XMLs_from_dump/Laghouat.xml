'''Laghouat''' ({{lang-en|'''Laghwat'''}} {{lang-fr|'''Laghouat'''}} {{lang-ar|الأغواط}}) is the [[capital city]] of the [[Laghouat Province]], [[Algeria]], 400&amp;nbsp;km south of the Algerian capital [[Algiers]]. As of 2005, the population of the city  was 126,291 inhabitants. Nearby, in [[Hassi R'Mel]], there is the largest [[natural gas]] reserve in Africa.

The city was founded in the 11th century. In 1852, the [[France|French]] [[Siege of Laghouat|captured the city]]. Since 1974, it has been the seat of a province of the same name.

Laghwat town in the [[Amour Range]] of the [[Saharan Atlas]] is an [[oasis]] on the north edge of the Sahara [[Desert]]. It is an important [[Public administration|administrative]] and [[military]] center and [[marketplace]], and is known for [[Carpet|rug]] and tapestry weaving. There are [[natural gas]] deposits in the region. The town has a [[meteorological station]]. 

Laghouat traces its history at least to the 11th century. It paid tribute to [[Morocco]] in the 17th [[century]]. The Turks captured Laghouat in 1786, and the [[France|French]] conquered the city in 1852.

The city is served by [[L'Mekrareg Airport|Laghouat Airport]] (IATA: '''LOO''', ICAO: '''DAUL''').

In January 2012 Laghouat was the site of [[2010–2012 Algerian protests|anti-government protests]] over housing, [[infrastructure]], and treatment of the elderly by [[police]].  The [[police]] used tear gas to disperse the [[protesters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 injured, several arrested in Algeria protests|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ic2rj6WFjN-Y4BuxjoEoECmPaBRg?docId=CNG.4e49b326c0b56a603281add8e86b2b2d.631|publisher=Agent France Press|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anger at squalid housing unleashes Algeria protest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/12/us-algeria-housing-protests-idUSTRE80B12A20120112|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The location and nature ==
Laghouat is a regional center in the Algerian depression, an [[oasis]] south of Algiers and lined with gardens. It is built on the banks of the Wadi Mzee, which flows eastwards from the [[Amour Range]] and is one of a large number of seasonal streams that empty into [[Chott Melrhir]].

It is bordered to the north by the municipality of [[Sidi Makhlouf]], to the west by [[Tadjemout]] and [[Kheneg]], to the east the municipality of [[El Assafia]], and to the south the municipality of [[Mekhareg]].
