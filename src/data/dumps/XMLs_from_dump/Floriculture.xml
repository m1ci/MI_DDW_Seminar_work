'''Floriculture''', or '''flower farming''', is a discipline of [[horticulture]] concerned with the cultivation of flowering and [[ornamental plant]]s for gardens and for [[floristry]], comprising the [[floral industry]]. The development, via [[plant breeding]], of new varieties is a major occupation of floriculturists.

Floriculture crops include bedding plants, [[houseplant]]s, flowering garden and [[pot plant]]s, cut cultivated greens, and [[cut flower]]s. As distinguished from nursery crops, floriculture crops are generally [[herbaceous]]. Bedding and garden plants consist of young flowering plants (annuals and [[perennial]]s) and vegetable plants. They are grown in [[cell pack]]s (in flats or trays), in pots, or in hanging baskets, usually inside a controlled environment, and sold largely for gardens and landscaping. ''[[Pelargonium]]'' (&quot;geraniums&quot;), ''[[Impatiens]]'' (&quot;busy lizzies&quot;), and ''[[Petunia]]'' are the best-selling bedding plants. The many [[cultivar]]s of ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'' are the major perennial garden plant in the United States.

Flowering plants are largely sold in pots for indoor use. The major flowering plants are [[poinsettia]]s, [[orchid]]s, florist [[chrysanthemum]]s, and finished florist [[azalea]]s. Foliage plants are also sold in pots and hanging baskets for indoor and patio use, including larger specimens for office, hotel, and restaurant interiors.

Cut flowers are usually sold in bunches or as bouquets with cut foliage. The production of cut flowers is specifically known as the '''cut flower industry'''. Farming flowers and foliage employs special aspects of floriculture, such as spacing, training and pruning plants for optimal flower harvest; and post-harvest treatment such as chemical treatments, storage, preservation and packaging. In Australia and the United States some species are harvested from the wild for the cut flower market.
