'''Qionghai''' ({{zh|s=琼海 |t=瓊海 |p=Qiónghǎi}}) is one of the seven [[county-level cities]] of [[Hainan]] province, China. Although [[Administrative divisions of China#Ambiguity of the word &quot;city&quot; in China|called a &quot;city&quot;]], Qionghai refers to a large land area in Hainan - an area which was once a county. Within this area is the main city, Qionghai City. It is located in the east of the island at the mouth of the [[Wanquan River]], {{convert|86|km}} from the provincial capital of [[Haikou]]. It has an area of {{convert|1692|km2}} and in 2010, it had a population of 483,217.

The seat of government is at Jiaji ({{zh|s=嘉积镇 |t=嘉積鎮 |p=Jiājī Zhèn |links=no}}), often now referred to simply as Qionghai. [[Bo'ao]], seat of the [[Boao Forum for Asia]], belongs to Qionghai City.

The former counties of Qiongdong ([[Postal romanization|postal]]: Kiungtung) and Lehui (樂㑹, [[Postal romanization|postal]]: Lokwei) are now part of Qiongdong City.

Qionghai is historically associated with the Red Detachment of Women, an all-female company of the Chinese Red Army who survived Nationalist persecution. A novel based on their story has been made into a ballet ([[Red Detachment of Women (ballet)|The Red Detachment of Women]]) and two films.

The most famous dish of Qionghai is Jiaji Duck, originally introduced to Qionghai by locals who returned from living in Southeast Asia.
