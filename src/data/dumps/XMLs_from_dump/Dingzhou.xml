'''Dingzhou''',&lt;!--Chinese in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; or '''Tingchow''' in [[Postal Map Romanization]], and formerly called '''Ding County''' or '''Dingxian''', is a [[county-level city]] in the [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Baoding]], [[Hebei|Hebei Province]]. As of 2009, Dingzhou had a population of 1.2 million. Dingzhou has 3 [[Subdistrict (China)|subdistricts]], 13 towns, 8 townships, and 1 ethnic township.&lt;ref name = &quot;Admin Div&quot;&gt;[http://www.xzqh.org/html/list/764.html 定州市-行政区网]&lt;/ref&gt; Dingzhou is about halfway between Baoding and [[Shijiazhuang]], {{convert|196|km|sp=us}} southwest of [[Beijing]], and {{convert|68|km|sp=us}} northeast of Shijiazhuang.

==History==
Dingzhou was originally known as '''Lunu''' in early [[imperial China]].&lt;ref name=bearman/&gt; A tomb about {{convert|4|km|sp=us}} southwest of Dingzhou from 55{{nbsp}}{{sc|bce}} was discovered and excavated in 1973. It contained several fragments of [[Chinese literature|Han literature]], including [[manuscript]]s of [[Confucius]]'s ''[[Analects]]'', the [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] ''[[Wenzi]]'', and the ''[[Six Secret Teachings]]'', a military treatise.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Dingzhou took its present name around 400{{nbsp}}{{sc|ce}} when it became the seat of [[Ding Prefecture]] under the [[Northern Wei]], displacing the earlier [[Anzhou (Northern China)|An Prefecture]].&lt;ref name=bearman&gt;{{harvp|Xiong|2017|loc=&quot;[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=fCdCDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 Dingzhou]&quot;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-6th century, its territory held 834,211 people living in 177,500 [[households]].&lt;ref name=bearman/&gt; Under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], the seat of [[Boling Commandery]] at present-day [[Anping, Hebei|Anping]] was renamed &quot;Gaoyang&quot;. In 607, Dingzhou then became the eponymous seat of a new '''Boling''' [[jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] and retained that name and status under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Boling |contribution-url=https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=fCdCDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69 |p=[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=fCdCDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69 69] |url=https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=fCdCDgAAQBAJ |title=Historical Dictionary of Medieval China |last=Xiong |first=Victor Cunrui |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]] |date=2017 |isbn=9781442276154 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; until it returned to the name Dingzhou between 621 and 742 and again after 758.&lt;ref name=bearman/&gt; Its territory held only 86,869 people in 25,637 households in 639 but recovered to 496,676 people in 78,090 households by 742.&lt;ref name=bearman/&gt;

In 1055, under the [[Song dynasty|Song]], the city became the home of the {{convert|84|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Liaodi Pagoda]], which is today China's tallest surviving pre-modern [[pagoda]].

Under the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|early Republic]], it was known as '''Dingxian''' ([[Postal Map Romanization|then romanized]] &quot;Tingsien&quot; or &quot;Ting Hsien&quot;) from its status as the seat of [[Ding County]]. From 1926 to 1937, the county was the site of the [[National Association of Mass Education Movement]]'s [[Ting Hsien Experiment]] of the [[Rural Reconstruction Movement]]. In the 1990s, the [[New Rural Reconstruction Movement]] maintained a training and outreach center.
