'''Bagepalli'''  is a town [[municipal council]] in [[Chikballapur district]]  in the state of [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. Bagepalli is situated 100&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Bangalore]] on the Bangalore-[[Hyderabad district (India)|Hyderabad]] National Highway. The region is just below the southern border of the [[Rayalaseema]]  in [[Andhra Pradesh]], South India. It is semi-arid and drought prone with 535&amp;nbsp;mm of erratic and spatial rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bagepallitown.mrc.gov.in/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Bagepalli is located at {{Coord|13.78|N|77.79|E|}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/19/Bagepalli.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Bagepalli]&lt;/ref&gt; It has an average elevation of 707&amp;nbsp;metres (2319&amp;nbsp;ft).

The region is a semi arid drought prone one with low, erratic and spatial rainfall. The dust brown rocky terrain is severely undulating, with small hill ranges and outcrops that stud the topography. There is no mineral wealth and only a very thin and fragile soil cover.

An adverse land:person ratio creates a strong thirst for cultivable land since less than one-half of the total land is fit for [[Tillage|cultivation]], with the remaining taken over by the hills and rocky fields. Hardly 5% of the cropped lands are irrigated by an age old network of rain-fed tanks (small lakes), each irrigating 2 to 10 hectares of wet land. The low water table is tapped through bore-wells drilled to more than 100 meters depth. Even these dry up in the summer months, from April to September every year, when temperatures rise to a dry heat of 38 Â°C.

The average rainfall is 535&amp;nbsp;mm a year and this is, moreover, erratic and spatial. As a result there is only 1 rain-fed crop a year, whose stand is from late June till December. Groundnuts are grown on these dry lands, inter-cropped with [[red gram]], [[cowpea]], field beans, [[green gram]], [[jowar]], [[maize]] and [[Castor oil plant|castor]] on the field bunds. Irrigated [[peanut|groundnut]], [[mulberry]], [[onions]] and [[sunflower]] are the common bore-well irrigated crops. [[Finger millet|Ragi]] (golden millet) and a coarse variety of paddy are cultivated under irrigation tanks. Every fifth or sixth year is a drought, followed by near famine conditions.

Seasonal migration by agricultural labourers is an annual occurrence during the summer months. They come back every June/July to scratch a subsistence cultivation from small patches of scattered holdings, far away from the villages and hugging the hillsides, averaging {{convert|2.6|acre|m2}} per [[Coolie]] family.

==Demographics==
As of 2001 India [[census]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&amp;state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&amp;state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|work= |publisher= Census Commission of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagepalli had a population of 1,69,689.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chikballapur.nic.in/district_areapopulation-1.html Chikballapur District Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125225440/http://www.chikballapur.nic.in/district_areapopulation-1.html |date=2010-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Males constitute 50.7% of the population and females 49.3%. Bagepalli has an average literacy rate of 63%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 56% of the males and 44% of females literate. 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.

Gummanayakana Palya - 20&amp;nbsp;km from Bagepalli

The palayapat of Gummanayakana Palya (also referred to as Gummanayakapalyam), to the northeast of Chikballapur, comprised the whole of the Bagepalli taluk in the far east of Mysore State and portions of the neighboring Hindupur and Kandukur taluks in the Presidency of Madras. It was founded in the second half of the 13th century by Khadripathi Nayaka (ob. 1272), a scion of a royal family in Cuddappah, who gradually established his ascendancy over the zamindars and the people of Pathapalya. He built a new capital in Devarajapalli and extended his rule over a wide area. Chinama Nayaka, his son (r. 1272-1296), named his principality after Gumma Reddy, one of the zamindars who had turned over his estates to Khadripathi Nayaka. He is also credited with having established an administrative system. Gumma Nayaka, the third ruler, (r. 1296-1314) had to submit to Anegundi and agree to pay tribute and provide military service. The sixth ruler, Kadarappa Nayaka (r. 1363-1388) helped the empire of Vijayanagar establish its control over the local polegars; for two centuries thereafter the polegars of Gummanayakana Palya were counted among the most loyal and distinguished chiefs under the kings of Vijayanagar. 

The battle of Talikota (1565) occurred during the rule of Viradasappa Nayaka (r. 1548-1584), the 19th polegar. While other Vijayanagar feudatories took advantage of this signal defeat to break free, &quot;the poligar of Gummanayakana Palya, true to his traditional loyalty, remained firm under the banner of the fallen House of Vijayanagar.&quot; During the succession wars of the early 1630s, Palegar Vasanta Nayaka refused to acknowledge Emperor Venkata Deva Raya III. Immadi Kempe Gowda of Bangalore, the emperor champion, laid waste the palegar's lands and forced him to submit. But after some time, even tribute stopped being collected by the increasingly ineffective rulers of Vijayanagar, and Gummanayakana Palya came under Moghul rule during the reign of Bangara Thimma Nayaka (r. 1680-1728). His successor Kadarappa Nayaka III (r. 1728-1740) had to switch allegiance to the Marathas and pay heavy tribute to the Peshwa. Narasimha Nayaka V (r. 1740-1760) was forced to cede part of his territories to Murarirao Ghorpade of Gooty (q.v.) and was later brought under tribute to Hyder Ali of Mysore, who nevertheless befriended him against his own subordinates. Tippu Sultan, however, embarked on a systematic policy of extermination of the palegars. Several small principalities were annexed and, despite Palegar Narasimha Nayaka VI's (r. 1765-1802) &quot;protestations of loyalty for generations to the Sultan of Mysore,&quot; his palayapat was invaded, the palegar and his family fleeing the country ahead of Tippu's troops. Narasimha was briefly restored during the Third Mysore War, but when peace was concluded in 1793, he was again dispossessed by the vengeful Tippu. During the Fourth Mysore War (1799), Narasimha Nayaka VI, with a large army of his own, joined the British in their final assault on Sringapatam. Promises made by the English commander to restore his palayapat after final victory over Tippu were not honored by Dewan Purneya of the restored Wadiyars of Mysore. Narasimha was forced to go into exile once more &quot;where he, the last Paligar to rule the ancient Palayapat [of] Gummanayakana Palya, died of grief.&quot;
