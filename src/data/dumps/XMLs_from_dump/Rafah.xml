'''Rafah''' ({{lang-ar|رفح}} – ''Rafaḥ'') is a [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] city and [[Palestinian refugee camps|refugee camp]] in the southern [[Gaza Strip]]. It is the district capital of the [[Rafah Governorate]], located {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} south of [[Gaza City]]. Rafah's population of 152,950 (2014) is overwhelmingly made up of [[Palestinian refugee]]s. [[Rafah camp]] and [[Tall as-Sultan]] camp form separate localities.

When Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, Rafah was split into a Gazan part and an [[Rafah, Egypt|Egyptian part]], dividing families, separated by barbed-wire barriers.&lt;ref name=cinderella/&gt;&lt;ref name=kliot_1995/&gt; The core of the city was destroyed by Israel&lt;ref name=Razing_Rafah&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060325230545/http://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/rafah1004/rafah1004text.pdf ''Razing Rafah — Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip''], pp. 27–28 and 52–66 (PDF text version) on [https://web.archive.org/web/20060325230545/http://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/rafah1004/], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060324012233/http://www.hrw.org/campaigns/gaza/ Summary:].

Human Rights Watch, September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to create a large [[Gaza–Egypt border#Buffer zone|buffer zone]].

Rafah is the site of the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], the sole crossing point between [[Egypt]] and the [[State of Palestine]]. Gaza's only airport, [[Yasser Arafat International Airport]], was located just south of the city. The airport operated from 1998 to 2001, until it was bombed and bulldozed by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]] (IDF) after the killing of Israeli soldiers by members of [[Hamas]].

==Etymology==
Over the ages it has been known as &quot;Robihwa&quot; by the ancient Egyptians, &quot;Rafihu&quot; by the [[Assyria]]ns, &quot;Ῥαφία, Rhaphia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Histories (Polybius)|Polybii Historiae]] [5,80].&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Greece|Greek]]s, &quot;Raphia&quot; by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], רפיח &quot;Rafiaḥ&quot; by the [[Israelites]], &quot;Rafh&quot; by the [[Arab Caliphate]]. The transliteration of the Hebrew name, &quot;Rafiah&quot;, is used in modern English alongside &quot;Rafah&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1153519&amp;fid=2245&amp;c=gaza_strip |title=Rafīah: Gaza Strip; name, map, geographic coordinates |publisher=Geographic.org |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Zaki|first=Chehab|year=2007|title=Inside Hamas: The Untold Story of Militants, Martyrs and Spies|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=180|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rWEg6Tfai_oC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=rafiah|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The Ottoman–British agreement of 1 October 1906 established a [[Borders of Israel#Border with Egypt|boundary between Ottoman ruled Palestine and British ruled Egypt]], from Taba to Rafah. After ''World War I'' Palestine was also under British control, but the Egypt-Palestine Boundary was maintained to control movement of the local [[Bedouin]]. From the mid-1930s the British enhanced the border control and Rafah evolved as a small boundary town which functioned as a trade and services centre for the semi-settled Beduin population.&lt;ref name=kliot_1995&gt;[https://www.dur.ac.uk/ibru/publications/download/?id=207 ''The Evolution of the Egypt-Israel Boundary: From Colonial Foundations to Peaceful Borders''], pp. 3, 9, 18. Nurit Kliot, Boundary and Territory Briefing, Volume 1 Number 8. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tESlCz39akkC&amp;printsec=frontcover At Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War it became an important British base.

Following the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Rafah was located in Egypt-occupied Gaza and consequently, a Gaza–Egypt border did no longer exist. Rafah could grow without any consideration being taken of the old 1906 international boundary.&lt;ref name=kliot_1995/&gt; In the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel conquered the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and all of the city now was under Israeli occupation.

In 1979, [[Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty|Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty]] that returned the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], which borders the Gaza Strip, to Egyptian control. In the Peace Treaty, the re-created Gaza–Egypt border was drawn across the city of Rafah. Rafah was divided into an Egyptian and a Palestinian part, splitting up families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Families were separated, property was divided and many houses and orchards were cut across and destroyed by the new boundary, bulldozed, allegedly for security reasons. Rafah became one of the three border points between Egypt and Israel.&lt;ref name=cinderella&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051022004151/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/761/re1.htm ''Cinderella in Rafah'']. Al-Ahram, Issue No. 761, 22–28 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kliot_1995/&gt;

==Demographics==
In 1922, Rafah's population was 599,&lt;ref name=Census1922/&gt; which increased to 2,220 in 1945.&lt;ref name=Hadawi46/&gt; In 1982, the total population was approximately 10,800.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestineremembered.com/GeoPoints/Rafah_1500/index.html Welcome to Rafah] Palestine Remembered.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1997 [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS) census, Rafah and its adjacent camp had a combined population of 91,181, [[Tall as-Sultan]] was listed with a further 17,141.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCBS1997&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/_PCBS/census/phc_97/raf_t1.aspx|title=Palestinian Population by Locality, Sex and Age Groups in Years|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palestinian refugee|Refugee]]s made up 80.3% of the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/raf_t6.aspx Palestinian Population by Locality and Refugee Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118200339/https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/raf_t6.aspx |date=2008-11-18 }}.

In the 2006 PCBS estimate, Rafah city had a population of 71,003,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCBS2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/populati/pop16.aspx|title=PCBS] [Palestinian Central Bureau of Statisctics (PCBS) Projected Mid-Year Population for Rafah Governorate by Locality 2004–2006|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rafah camp]] and [[Tall as-Sultan]] form separate localities for census purposes, having populations of 59,983 and 24,418, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCBS2006&quot; /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gaza Strip map2.svg|thumb|right|Rafah is at the bottom of map.]]
Rafah has a history stretching back thousands of years. It was first recorded in an inscription of Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti&amp;nbsp;I]], from 1303 BCE as ''Rph'', and as the first stop on Pharaoh [[Shoshenq&amp;nbsp;I]]'s campaign to the [[Levant]] in 925&amp;nbsp;BCE. In 720 BCE it was the site of the [[Assyria]]n king [[Sargon&amp;nbsp;II]]'s victory over the [[Egyptians]], and in 217&amp;nbsp;BCE the [[Battle of Raphia]] was fought between the victorious [[Ptolemy IV of Egypt|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;IV]] and [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus&amp;nbsp;III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;STFJ&quot;&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/127discuss.html Raphia – (Rafah)] Studium Biblicum Franciscanum – Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt; (It is said to be one of the largest battles ever fought in the Levant, with over a hundred thousand soldiers and hundreds of [[elephant]]s).

The town was conquered by [[Alexander Yannai]] and held by the [[Hasmonean]]s until it was rebuilt in the time of [[Pompey]] and [[Aulus Gabinius|Gabinius]]; the latter seems to have done the actual work of restoration for the era of the town dates from 57&amp;nbsp;BCE. Rafah is mentioned in [[Strabo]] (16, 2, 31), the [[Antonine Itinerary]], and is depicted on the [[Map of Madaba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;STFJ&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, it was a [[diocese]],&lt;ref name=&quot;STFJ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bingham, Origines Ecclesiasticae; Or the Antiquities of the Christian Church and Other Works: In Nine Volumes, Volume 3(Straker, 1843) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jJAAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=Diocese+of+Raphia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4yvtGmoKQG&amp;sig=C_bIlRO-nniKGFpDBKbC4zPueH4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBw5Psud_KAhUDHJQKHWz5AMwQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Diocese%20of%20Raphia&amp;f=false p 61].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Byzantine]] [[ceramics]] and [[coin]]s have been found there.&lt;ref&gt;Dauphin, 1998, p. 953&lt;/ref&gt; It was represented at the [[Council of Ephesus]] 431 CE by Bishop Romanus, but today remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;Tadrous Y. Malaty, Introduction to the Coptic Orthodox Church OrthodoxEbooks,1993) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TrhLRZmCqX8C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Diocese+of+Raphia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=scmm2esCvN&amp;sig=3x-7ZLpOs6MdoIepkBUF2ySTFL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBw5Psud_KAhUDHJQKHWz5AMwQ6AEIPDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Raphia&amp;f=false page 13].&lt;/ref&gt; but a small [[Greek Orthodox]] presence exists.

===Arab and Mamluk rule===
Rafah was an important trading city during the early [[Arab]] period, and one of the towns captured by the [[Rashidun army]] under general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] in 635 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[al-Biladhuri|al&amp;#8209;Biladhuri]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/xix/mode/1up xix]. Al-Biladhuri lists the cities captured by Amr ibn al-'As as Ghazzah (Gaza), Sebastiya ([[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]]), [[Nabulus]], Amwas ([[Imwas]]), Kaisariyya ([[Caesarea]]), [[Yibna]], Ludd ([[Lod|Lydda]]), Rafh (Rafah), [[Bayt Jibrin]], and Yaffa ([[Jaffa]]). Cited in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/28/mode/1up 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s, Rafah was the southernmost border of [[Jund Filastin]] (&quot;District of Palestine&quot;). According to Arab geographer [[al-Ya'qubi|al&amp;#8209;Ya'qubi]], it was the last town in the Province of Syria and on the road from [[Ramla]] to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;le Strange&quot;&gt;le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/517/mode/1up 517]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Jew]]ish community settled in the city in the 9th and 10th centuries and again in the 12th, although in the 11th century it suffered a decline and in 1080 they migrated to [[Ashkelon]]. A [[Samaritan]] community also lived there during this period. Like most cities of southern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], ancient Rafah had a landing place on the coast (now Tell Rafah), while the main city was inland.&lt;ref name=&quot;STFJ&quot;/&gt;

In 1226, Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] writes of Rafah's former importance in the early Arab period, saying it was &quot;of old a flourishing town, with a market, and a [[mosque]], and hostelries&quot;. However, he goes on to say that in its current state, Rafah was in ruins, but was an [[Ayyubid]] postal station on the road to Egypt after nearby [[Deir al-Balah|Deir al&amp;#8209;Balah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;le Strange&quot;/&gt;

===Ottoman and Egyptian period===
Rafah appeared in the 1596 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[daftar|tax registers]] as being in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of Gaza of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of [[Gaza Sanjak|Gazza]]. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and/or bee hives.&lt;ref name=Hutteroth&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799, the Revolutionary Army of [[France]] commanded by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] passed through Rafah during the [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt#Syrian Campaign|invasion of Egypt and Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dwyer&quot;&gt;Dwyer, 2007, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafah was the boundary between the provinces of Egypt and Syria. In 1832, the area came under Egyptian occupation of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], which lasted until 1840.

The French explorer [[Victor Guérin]], who visited in May 1863, noted two pillars of granite which the locals called ''Bab el Medinet,'' meaning &quot;The Gate of the town&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1869, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog02gu#page/233/mode/1up 233]-35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, [[Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria]] wrote: &quot;Fragments of gray granite pillars, still standing, are here to be met with about the road, the fields, and the sand, and we saw one lying on the ground half buried... The pillars are the remains of an ancient temple, Raphia, and are of special importance in the eyes of the Arabs, who call them Rafah, as they mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Salvator, Archduke of Austria, 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/caravanroutebetw00ludwrich#page/54/mode/1up 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

===British mandate era===
In 1917, the [[Battle of Rafa|British army captured Rafah]], and used it as a base for [[First Battle of Gaza (1917)|their attack on Gaza]]. The presence of the army bases was an economic draw that brought people back to the city.

In the [[1922 census of Palestine]] conducted by the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate authorities]], Rafah had a population of 599 inhabitants, all Muslim,&lt;ref name=Census1922&gt;Barron, 1923, Table V, [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|Sub-district of Gaza]], p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n10/mode/1up  8]&lt;/ref&gt; increasing in the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]] to 1,423, still all Muslims, in 228 houses.&lt;ref name=Census1931&gt;Mills, 1932, p. [https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rafah 1931.jpg|thumb|Rafah 1931 1:20,000]]

In the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]] Rafah had a population of 2,220, all Muslims,&lt;ref name=1945p12&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/VSpages/VS1945_p32.jpg  32]&lt;/ref&gt; with 40,579 [[dunam]]s of land, according to an official land and population survey.&lt;ref name=Hadawi46&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

===1948–1967===
[[File:14_-_Destroyed_mosque.jpg|thumb|right|Mosque in Rafah, destroyed during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]]]
After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Egypt governed the area (see [[All-Palestine Protectorate|Palestinian Protectorate]]) and refugee camps were established. In the [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] involving Israel, Britain, France, and Egypt, 111 people, including 103 refugees, were killed by the Israeli army in the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, during the [[Rafah massacre]]. The United Nations was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6558F61D3DB6BD4505256593006B06BE |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104160006/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6558F61D3DB6BD4505256593006B06BE |archivedate=2013-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/place.php?plid=210|title=Rafah (articles/books/maps/cartoons/photographs/video or audio clips)|website=cosmos.ucc.ie|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the [[Israel Defense Forces]] captured Rafah with the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Gaza Strip]], the population was about 55,000, of whom only 11,000 lived in Rafah itself.

===After 1967===
In the summer of 1971, the IDF, under General [[Ariel Sharon]] (then head of the [[Israeli Southern Command|IDF southern command]]), destroyed approximately 500 houses in the refugee camps of Rafah in order to create patrol roads for Israeli forces. These demolitions displaced nearly 4,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/858c88eb973847f4802564b5003d1083!OpenDocument UN Doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212181417/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/858c88eb973847f4802564b5003d1083%21OpenDocument |date=2007-02-12 }} A/8389 of 5 October 1971 (h) The continued transfer of the population of the occupied territories to other areas within the occupied territories.

According to a report in the [[Jerusalem Post]] of 17 May 1971, Mr. [[Teddy Kollek]], Israeli Mayor of Jerusalem, stated that 4,000 Arabs had been evacuated from Jerusalem. Likewise, in the case of Gaza, according to reports appearing in several newspapers and in letters addressed by Governments, several thousands of persons were displaced from the three major refugee camps in Gaza. Official Israeli sources have stated that these transfers of population were necessitated by new security measures, such as the construction of wider roads inside the camps in order to facilitate patrolling and the maintenance of law and order in the camps. Most of the persons whose refugee accommodation was destroyed to permit of the construction of these roads were forced to leave for the West Bank and El Arish, while a few were said to have sought refuge with other families inside Gaza. The Special Committee considers that the transfers were unwarranted and that even if the construction of new roads was considered indispensable for the maintenance of law and order, the arbitrary transfer of population was unnecessary, unjustified and in breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel established the Brazil and Canada [[housing project]]s to accommodate [[Palestinian refugee|displaced Palestinians]] and to provide better conditions in the hopes of integrating the refugees into the general population and its standard of living;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shaml.org/publications/monos/mono4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914074542/http://www.shaml.org/publications/monos/mono4.htm |archivedate=2006-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil is immediate south of Rafah, while Canada was just across the border in Sinai. Both were named because [[UN]] peacekeeping troops from those respective countries had maintained barracks in those locations. After the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]] mandated the repatriation of Canada project refugees to the Gaza Strip, the Tel al-Sultan project, northwest of Rafah, was built to accommodate them.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch.

In May 2004, the Israeli Government led by, yet Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon approved another [[Gaza–Egypt border#2004 expansion, Operation Rainbow|mass demolition of homes]] in Rafah. Therefore, he obtained the nickname &quot;the bulldozer&quot;.&lt;ref name=hrw_map2&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/rafah1004/5.htm ''Razing Rafah''], Map 2: Rafah Features.

In September 2005, [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip]] but Rafah remained divided, with part of it on the Egyptian side of the border under Egyptian rule. It has been claimed that it was in order to cope with the division of the town, [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnel|that smugglers have made tunnels]] under the border, connecting the two parts and permitting the smuggling of goods and persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafahtoday.org/about/rafah.htm About Rafah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130141739/http://rafahtoday.org/about/rafah.htm |date=2009-01-30}} Rafah Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rafah Border Crossing==
[[File:Border between Israel and Egypt visible from space.jpg|thumbnail|The city of Rafah, split by the border into an Egyptian part and a Gazan part, is located at the center of the image.]]
Rafah is the site of the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], the sole crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to the [[Palestinian Authority]] in September 2005 as part of the larger [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israeli withdrawal]] from the Gaza Strip. A [[European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah|European Union commission began monitoring]] the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]]'s Presidential Guard assumed responsibility for the site on the Palestinian Authority side.&lt;ref&gt;Mitch Potter, Something that works: the Rafah crossing, ''The Toronto Star'', May 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;    On the Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards allowed by an agreement of Egypt with Israel. The agreement was signed in November 2005 forced by US pressure, and specifies that it is under security requirements demanded by Israel.
