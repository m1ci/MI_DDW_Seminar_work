'''Phara''' ({{lang-grc|Φαρά}}) was a [[ancient Greece|Greek]] city in [[ancient Acarnania]].&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen,2005,page 370&lt;/ref&gt; 

The only ancient source that mentions it is the ''[[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]'', 34, which lists the πὸλις ([[polis]]) Φαρά between [[Leukada]] and [[Ithaca]]. Some scholars place it in Leukada and identify the settlement with the current [[Pyrgi (Lefkada)|Pyrgi]].&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt; Others note that Pseudo-Scylax orders Phara after Leukada and if he had wanted to classify it as a Leukadian ''polis'', he would have said the island had two ''poleis''. Thus, Phara could be one of the small islands between Leukada and Ithaca or be located on the coast of Acarnania in the ''perea'' of Leukada. If this interpretation of the text of the ''Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax'' is accepted, it would have to be classified as an unlocated polis of Acarnania.
