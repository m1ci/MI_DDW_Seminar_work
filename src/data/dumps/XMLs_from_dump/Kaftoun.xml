They are mostly of [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal and ikhtiyariah elections in Northern Lebanon |url=http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMonthly-Municip-Mar10-E92.pdf |publisher=The Monthly |accessdate=1 November 2016 |page=23 |date=March 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603040803/http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMonthly-Municip-Mar10-E92.pdf |archivedate= 3 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village is famous for the Moussa-Georges family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kifraya.com/default.htm Kifraya website]&lt;/ref&gt;
The name &quot;Kaftoun&quot; in the ancient [[Aramaic language]] means &quot;dug from&quot; or &quot;sculpted from&quot; a cliff and also (Kftuna) could means &quot;the domed&quot;. 

Semaan (سمعان) is the biggest family in Kaftoun.

Both roots of the word lead us to believe that the village of Kaftoun was named after the domed Theotokos Monastery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaftoun.com/gallery?func=viewcategory&amp;section=kaftoun&amp;catid=71&amp;section_id=1 Photo Gallery].
