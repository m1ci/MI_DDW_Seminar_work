'''Sacatepéquez''' ({{IPA-es|sakateˈpekes}}) was a city in [[Guatemala]] from November 21, 1542 until July 29, 1773 when it was destroyed by the [[Santa Marta earthquake]]. Sacatepéquez means ''grasshill'' and gave its name to the [[Sacatepéquez Department]].

Sacatepéquez and [[Antigua Guatemala]] were the two municipalities belonging to the department of [[Chimaltenango (department)|Chimaltenango]].

On September 12, 1839, the department of Sacatepéquez was created, getting its name from the former city. [[Antigua Guatemala]] was made the capital.
