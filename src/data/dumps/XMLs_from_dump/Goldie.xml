'''Clifford Joseph Price''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 19 September 1965 in [[Walsall]], [[England]])&lt;ref name=&quot;ninelives&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldie, Gorman, Paul|title=Nine Lives|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton: 2002|ISBN=0-340-82478-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;, better known as '''Goldie''', is a British [[musician]], [[music producer]], [[DJ]], [[visual artist]] and [[actor]].

Initially gaining exposure for his work as a [[graffiti]] artist, Goldie became well known for his pioneering role as a musician in the 1990s UK [[Jungle music|jungle]], [[drum and bass]] and [[breakbeat hardcore]] scenes. He released a variety of singles under the pseudonym '''Rufige Kru''' and co-founded the label [[Metalheadz]]. He would later release several albums under his own name, including the 1995 album ''[[Timeless (Goldie album)|Timeless]]'', which entered the UK charts at number 7.

Goldie's acting credits include the 1999 [[James Bond]] film ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', [[Guy Ritchie]]'s ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000) and the [[BBC]]  soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' (2001-2002). He has also appeared in a number of celebrity reality television shows, including ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 2]]'' (UK), ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[Maestro (TV series)|Maestro]]''.

==Early life==
Price is of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ninelives&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoAndroidsDance&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Barr |url=http://doandroidsdance.com/features/precious-metalheadz/1/ |title=Goldie: Precious Metalheadz |publisher=DoAndroidsDance.com |date=17 March 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2014 |location=New York |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211114544/http://doandroidsdance.com/features/precious-metalheadz/1/ |archivedate=11 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was put up for [[adoption]] and raised in childcare homes and by several [[foster parents]].&lt;ref name=DoAndroidsDance/&gt; According to his 2002 autobiography, he was physically and sexually abused during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;djmag2017&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://djmag.com/features/goldies-voyage-another-galaxy|title=Goldie's voyage into another galaxy: DJ Mag cover story|date=2017-06-27|website=[[DJ Mag]]|access-date=2019-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price was a member of the [[breakdance]] crew Westside, based in the [[Whitmore Reans]] and [[Heath Town]] areas of [[Wolverhampton]], in the 1980s. He later joined a breakdance crew called the Birmingham [[Bboy]]s, and made his name as a [[graffiti]] artist in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]].

His artwork around [[Birmingham]] and [[Wolverhampton]] was featured heavily in [[Dick Fontaine]]'s documentary ''Bombin'''. He took part in the largest-ever British graffiti art battle alongside [[Bristol]] artist [[Robert Del Naja|Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja]], who later formed [[Massive Attack]]. He is mentioned for his graffiti in the book ''[[Spraycan Art]]'' by [[Henry Chalfant]] and [[James Prigoff]], which contains several examples of his art.

He moved to the United States owing to graffiti projects, and also started selling [[grill (jewelry)|grills]] (gold teeth jewellery) in New York and Miami; he continued this business after his return to the UK in 1988.&lt;ref name=DoAndroidsDance /&gt; His nickname stems from &quot;Goldielocks&quot;, an earlier nickname given to him during his Bboys days and subsequently shortened when he no longer wore [[dreadlocks]].&lt;ref name=DoAndroidsDance /&gt;

==Music==
By 1991, Price had become fascinated by the British [[breakbeat]] music scene when his girlfriend, DJ [[Kemistry]], introduced him to the pioneering [[Oldskool jungle|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]] [[record producer|producers]] Dennis &quot;Dego&quot; McFarlane and Mark &quot;Marc Mac&quot; Clair, known as [[4hero]].&lt;ref name=DoAndroidsDance /&gt; He went on to execute some design and [[A&amp;R]] work for [[4hero]]'s [[Reinforced Records]] label.

In 1992, Price made his first appearance, by contributing to an EP by Icelandic group, Ajax Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grapevine.is/culture/music/2011/03/17/remembering-biogen | title=Remembering Biogen/ | author=Ragnar Egilsson | work=Reykjavík Grapevine | date= 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the track was repeatedly misattributed to Price himself, perhaps because of his subsequent use of &quot;Rufige&quot; as moniker for his own releases.

His releases ''Killa Muffin'' b/w ''Krisp Biscuit'' and the ''Dark Rider'' [[Extended play|EP]] were released under the alias &quot;Rufige Cru&quot; on Reinforced.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Goldie timeless tattoo.jpg|thumb|Goldie next to a &quot;Metalheadz&quot; tattoo, 2001.]]

His first studio album, ''[[Timeless (Goldie album)|Timeless]]'', followed in 1995. ''Timeless'' entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number seven.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| page= 230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album fused the [[breakbeat]]s and basslines common in jungle with orchestral textures and [[soul music|soul]] vocals by [[Diane Charlemagne]]. The album's title track was a 21-minute [[symphony|symphonic]] piece. &quot;[[Inner City Life]]&quot;, a track from the album, reached number 39 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt; ''Timeless'' helped to popularise drum and bass as a form of [[musical expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John| last=Bush |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/goldie-p168851/biography |title=Goldie |website=AllMusic |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that Price's credentials as a musical innovator – and particularly as one of the key driving forces of innovation in the jungle/breakbeat scene – were exceptional. &quot;Goldie revolutionised jungle not once but thrice&quot;, he noted in ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' magazine, continuing, &quot;First there was 'Terminator' (pioneering the use of time stretching), then 'Angel' (fusing [[Diane Charlemagne]]'s live vocal with [[David Byrne]]/[[Brian Eno]] samples to prove that hardcore could be more 'conventionally' musical), now there's 'Timeless', a 22-minute hardcore symphony.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reynolds /&gt;

In 1996, he released the ''Toasted Both Sides Please'' remix of the [[Bush (band)|Bush]] song &quot;[[Swallowed (song)|Swallowed]]&quot;, which topped charts in the USA and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Billboard+Modern+Rock+Tracks+bush+swallowed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KW9CQWJRUA&amp;sig=TPEQWrRzaw36X3NEdYARzjDbWf4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NzhITuPCO8WZhQe-s9G8Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Billboard%20Modern%20Rock%20Tracks%20bush%20swallowed&amp;f=false |title=Billboard – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=16 November 1996 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jjheath.com/ModR1996.html |title=Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks Top 39 of 1996 |publisher=Jjheath.com |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&amp;file_num=nlc008388.9882&amp;type=1&amp;interval=24&amp;PHPSESSID=c1q4gj2dnd4leu6d7gg7rpv304 |title=Rock/Alternative – Volume 64, No. 16, December 02 1996 |author=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |date=2 December 1996 |accessdate=26 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022125923/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&amp;file_num=nlc008388.9882&amp;type=1&amp;interval=24&amp;PHPSESSID=c1q4gj2dnd4leu6d7gg7rpv304 |archive-date=22 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price released his second album, ''[[Saturnz Return]]'', in 1998. The album's opening track, &quot;Mother&quot;, is an hour-long orchestral drum and bass piece. The album featured appearances by [[David Bowie]], [[Noel Gallagher]] and [[KRS-One]]. The album met with mixed reviews. David Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the album &quot;ambitious but monotonous and overlong — [[Pink Floyd]] with a gold tooth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Brown|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1998/02/06/saturnz-return/|title=Saturnz Return|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 6, 1998|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Price said that he had been working for three years on a film called ''Sine Tempus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigelberman.co.uk/feature1_nov2002.htm |title=new insight – feature article, Roger McGough interview |publisher=Nigelberman.co.uk |accessdate=12 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123145756/http://www.nigelberman.co.uk/feature1_nov2002.htm |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; described as a coming-of-age story of a young paintbrush artist.  In 2006, he announced the soundtrack as his new album.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/goldie-lookin-back-6111901.html| title=Goldie: lookin' back | author=Rahul Verma| date=13 January 2006| work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released via the Metalheadz website in 2008, but the film has not been released.

Price is known for his work as the leader of Rufige Kru. The group has no fixed members and has included drum and bass producers such as Technical Itch, Heist, Cujo, Agzilla Da Ice, Danny J, [[Doc Scott]] and [[Rob Playford]].

March 2013 saw the release of ''The Alchemist: The Best of Goldie 1992–2012'', featuring prominent tracks from throughout Price's musical career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Alchemist-Best-Of-1992-2012/dp/B00B7PJM7E |title=The Alchemist: Best Of 1992–2012: Amazon.co.uk: Music |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent compilation, the three-CD Masterpiece set released by Ministry of Sound in 2014, brought together tracks that influenced him ([[Soul II Soul]]'s &quot;Back To Life&quot;, [[Roy Ayers]]' &quot;Everybody Loves The Sunshine&quot;) with cuts that soundtracked his entry into the rave scene and key moments from the drum'n'bass scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=25522|title=Full details of Goldie's Masterpiece revealed|first=Resident|last=Advisor|date=|website=residentadvisor.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Goldie album [[The Journey Man (Goldie album)|''The Journey Man'']] was released, which Price described as his &quot;[[magnum opus]]&quot; and &quot;the most important thing that I’ve ever made.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;djmag2017&quot;/&gt;

==Acting career==
Price has appeared in [[Guy Ritchie]]'s ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' and several other films, most notably the [[James Bond]] film, ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''.

Price starred in ''[[Everybody Loves Sunshine]]'' (1999) (aka ''B.U.S.T.E.D.'' – United States title) with [[David Bowie]].

==Television appearances==
In the late 1980s, Price appeared on ''Central Weekend'', a Friday evening topical debate show on [[ITV Central|Central TV]], promoting [[graffiti]] as an art form. He had a small documentary made about his own art on Central TV's ''Here and Now'' programme featuring [[Pogus Caesar]]'s photographs of New York. He has appeared on various young people's TV shows as part of a [[breakdance]] crew, the [[Bboy]]s from Wolverhampton. In 1995, he appeared on ''[[Passengers (TV series)|Passengers]]'', and in a [[Channel 4]] documentary about himself in 1998.

His next TV appearance was hosting ''Crime Business'' on the digital TV channels [[Bravo (UK TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Ftn (TV channel)|Ftn]].  He presented the documentary series ''The World's Deadliest Gangs'' on Bravo in 2002.

Price appeared on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 2 (UK)|second series]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' in 2002. He was the first celebrity to be &quot;evicted&quot;. In 2006, he was scheduled to appear in ''[[The Games (UK TV series)|The Games]]'', a UK reality TV show on Channel 4, but during training for the water-ski jump event he [[Bone fracture|fractured]] his [[femur]] and was unable to take part in the show. He was replaced by [[Adam Rickitt]]. In 2009, he was reported to be suing the producers of the show for damages as a result of the injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/05/06/rapper-goldie-sues-c4-s-the-games-for-300k-over-injury-115875-21335882|title=Rapper Goldie sues C4's The Games for £300k over injury|publisher=Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During August and September 2008, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[Maestro (TV series)|Maestro]]'', a reality television show in which eight celebrities, including Price, learned to conduct a concert orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;djmag2017&quot;/&gt; Price was placed second, behind [[Sue Perkins]].

On 31 July 2009, the first of a two-part television programme ''[[Classic Goldie]]'' was broadcast, showing how in the wake of his success in the ''Maestro'' programme he learns to write a score for a large orchestra and choir. The resulting composition, commissioned by the BBC and entitled ''Sine Tempore'' (''Timeless''), was performed at two children's [[The Proms|Promenade concerts]] in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 1 and 2 August 2009, which featured music connected with [[Charles Darwin]] and the creation and evolution of the world.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Proms programme, 1 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on ''[[Celebrity Mastermind]]'' on 27 December 2009 and came fourth behind [[Paul O'Grady]], [[Gail Emms]] and [[Loyd Grossman]]. On 11 September 2010, he was announced as part of the line-up in ''[[Strictly Come Dancing (series 8)|Strictly Come Dancing]]'' staying in the competition for two weeks.

On 22 December 2010, he appeared in a ''[[Celebrity Come Dine with Me]]'' [[Christmas special]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/come-dine-with-me/episode-guide/series-20/episode-19 |title=Come Dine with Me – Series 20 – Episode 19 – Celebrity Christmas Special |publisher=Channel 4 |date=22 December 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2011, he appeared in a three-part reality television series, '' [[Goldie's Band: By Royal Appointment]]'' in which he led a group of music experts as they conducted a nationwide search for young talented musicians and then selected and coached 12 of them, who collaborated to create some musical pieces for a performance at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/10_october/22/goldie.shtml|title=Goldie's band perform for Prince Harry at Buckingham Palace|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=22 October 2010|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2012, he appeared in the Channel 4 documentary ''Idris Elba's How Clubbing Changed the World'' (hosted by [[Idris Elba]]) to explain how he invented the revolutionary technique of [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching]] by misusing an [[high frequency|HF]] ultra-harmonizer, which is usually used for guitars. He then went on to say that when he crossed this with digital [[breakbeat]], the sound evolved from [[Oldskool jungle|jungle]] into [[drum and bass]].

In 2014, he appeared on the [[telethon]] ''[[BBC Children in Need]]''.

==Art==
In 2007, Price returned to the art world with an art exhibition, &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;, which was held at the Leonard Street Gallery, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/pop/story/0,,2176650,00.html |title=Portrait of the artist: Goldie, musician |publisher=The Guardian (London)|date= 25 September 2007|accessdate=12 May 2009 | location=| first=Laura | last=Barnett}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he teamed up with [[Pete Tong]] to provide much of the artwork for Tong's new [[Wonderland (event)|Wonderland]] club night at Eden nightclub in [[Sant Antoni de Portmany|San Antonio]], [[Ibiza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famemagazine.co.uk/2008/04/22/pete-tong-new-ibiza-plans-at-the-eden/ |title=Pete Tong new Ibiza plans at the Eden |publisher=Famemagazine.co.uk |date=22 April 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120052220/http://www.famemagazine.co.uk/2008/04/22/pete-tong-new-ibiza-plans-at-the-eden/ |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
