      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Wilusa''', ({{lang-hit|{{cuneiform|ð’Œ·ð’ƒ¾ð’‡»ð’Š­}}}} {{transl|hit|&lt;sup&gt;[[URU (Sumerogram)|URU]]&lt;/sup&gt;''wi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-lu-Å¡a''}}) or '''Wilusiya''', was a major city of the late [[Bronze Age]] in western [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joachim Latacz|J. Latacz]], ''[http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/troia/eng/wilusaeng.pdf Wilusa (Wilios/Troia)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606173702/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/troia/eng/wilusaeng.pdf |date=2011-06-06 }}'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It was described in 13th century BC [[Hittite language|Hittite]] sources as being part of a [[confederation]] named [[Assuwa]].

The city is often identified with the '''[[Troy]]''' of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Epic Cycle]]. Many modern archaeologists have suggested that Wilusa corresponds to an archaeological site in Turkey known as [[Troy VIIa]], which was destroyed circa 1190 BC. '''''Ilios''''' and '''''Ilion''''' (á¼¼Î»Î¹Î¿Ï‚, á¼¼Î»Î¹Î¿Î½), which are alternate names for Troy in the [[Ancient Greek]] language, are linked [[etymology|etymologically]] to Wilusa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; This identification by modern scholars has been influenced by the [[Chronicon (Jerome)|''Chronicon'']] (a chronology of mythical and Ancient Greece) written circa 380 AD by [[Jerome|Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus]] (also known as Saint Jerome). In addition, the modern [[Biga Peninsula]], on which Troy VIIa is located, is now generally believed to correspond to both the Hittite placename '''TaruiÅ¡a''' and the '''[[Troad|Troas]]''' or '''Troad''' of late antiquity.

Not all scholars have accepted the identification of Wilusa with Troy. There is an alternative hypothesis, for example, that Wilusa was located near [[Beycesultan]], which was known in the [[Byzantine era]] as &quot;Iluza&quot; (á¼¼Î»Î¿Ï…Î¶Î±).&lt;ref&gt;[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0cPPGU7IctEUDlvbzVzMHVyMzg/view Vangelis D. Pantazis (Nikaea), &quot;Wilusa: Reconsidering the Evidence&quot;, ''KLIO'', 91 (2009), Ïƒ. 305-307.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilusa ''per se'' is known from six references in Hittite sources, including:
* the [[Manapa-Tarhunta letter]] (c. 1310â€“1280 BC);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fManapa-Tarhunta+Letter.html Translation of the Manapa-Tarhunta Letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104112702/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FManapa-Tarhunta+Letter.html |date=2013-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which places it beyond the [[Seha]] river;
* the [[Alaksandu treaty]]  (c. 1280 BC), between [[Alaksandu]] of Wilusa and [[Muwatalli II]] of Hatti;
* the [[Tawagalawa letter]] (c. 1250 BC), addressed to the king of the [[Ahhiyawa]] by [[Hattusili III]], mentioning a military conflict over Wilusa, and;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffner, Beckman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7B2y1lSFMFAC&amp;pg=PA297 Letters from the Hittite Kingdom]'', 2009. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Milawata letter]] (C. 1240 BC), believed to be written by [[Tudhaliya IV]] of Hatti, discussing the reinstallation of [[Walmu]] as king of Wilusa.
