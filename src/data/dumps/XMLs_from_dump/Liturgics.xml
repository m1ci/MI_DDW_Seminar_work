'''Liturgics''' is the [[academic discipline]] dedicated to the study of [[liturgy]] (public worship rites, rituals, and practices). Liturgics scholars typically specialize in a single approach drawn from another scholarly field.  The most common sub-disciplines are: [[history]] or [[church history]], [[theology]], and [[anthropology]]. Although liturgics scholars using these approaches apply the principles of their respective disciplines to their research, all liturgics scholars focus their work in the [[ritual]] behaviors of the members of faith communities.
