'''Fuenlabrada''' ({{IPA-es|fwenlaˈβɾaða}}) is a city and municipality in the [[Community of Madrid]], [[Spain]]. It is to the south of the region, 22.5&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Madrid]]. {{As of|2018}}, it has a population of 193,586, making it the region's fourth most populated municipality.

== Placename ==
The name probably has its origin in ''Fuente Labrada'' (Spanish for &quot;carved fountain&quot;).

== History ==
The first information about Fuenlabrada was recorded 200 years after its founding because of an ambitious project promoted by [[Philip II of Spain]], the [[Topographic Relations of Philip II]].
All the cities, towns and villages received a royal order by which they were obliged to answer an extensive questionnaire about everything related to history, geography, economics, demography, customs... It is all about the  historic-geographic relations of all the villages of [[Spain]]. With the many pieces of information gathered by that questionnaire an accurate report of Fuenlabrada was created in the 16th century.

The city is linked with the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-50|M-50]], [[Autovía A-42|A-42]], M-506, M-407 and M-409 highways. It is connected as well to the neighbouring towns of [[Humanes de Madrid]] and [[Moraleja de Enmedio]] through the M-413 and M-405 local roads, respectively.
