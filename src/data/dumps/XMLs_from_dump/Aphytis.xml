'''Aphytis''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄφυτις}}), also '''Aphyte''' (Ἀφύτη) and '''Aphytus''' or '''Aphytos''' (Ἄφυτος),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DGRG|title=Aphytis}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient Greek city in [[Pallene, Chalcidice|Pallene]], the westernmost headland of [[Chalkidiki|Chalcidice]]. Around the middle of the 8th century BC colonists from [[Euboea]] arrived. The city became well known for its Temple of [[Dionysus]], which appears to have been built in the second half of the 8th century BC.  At Aphytis, [[Ammon (god)|Ammon]] was worshipped, at least from the time of the Spartan general [[Lysander]], as zealously as in Ammonium, sanctuary in Libya. According to Pausanias, the patron of Aphytis, Ammon Zeus, appeared in a dream to Lysander and urged him to raise the siege, which he did. The Temple of Ammon Zeus, whose few remaining ruins date to the 4th century BC structure.

During archaic and classical times Aphytis was a prosperous city, minting its own coins, which depicted the head of its patron, Ammon Zeus, the city's economy appears to have been mainly based on farming and vine-culture. [[Aristotle]] (Politics  V,VI 1319 a14)  mentions the &quot;agricultural law&quot; of the Aphytians, a special, singular and interesting chapter in the history of ancient Greek public finances.&lt;ref&gt;The household as the foundation of Aristotle's polis By D. Brendan Nagle [https://books.google.com/books?id=DI8wsv6TYXgC&amp;pg=RA3-PA74&amp;dq=Aphytis+city+Aristotle#v=onepage&amp;q=Aphytis%20city%20Aristotle&amp;f=false Page 74]  {{ISBN|978-0-521-84934-0}} (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The city became a member of the [[Chalkidian League]]; it previously paid tribute under the [[Thracian phoros]] of the [[Delian League]].

During Hellenistic and Roman times the city minted coins again; an event possibly related to the fame of the Temple of Ammon Zeus. Strabo mentions Aphytis among the five cities, which existed in Pallene in the first century B.C. ([[Cassandreia]], Aphytis, [[Mende (Chalcidice)|Mende]], [[Scione]] and [[Sane (Pallene)|Sane]]). After the founding of the Roman colony of Cassandreia (43 BC), Aphytis was a vicus of this colony, dependent administratively on it. &lt;ref&gt;[http://olympias.lib.uoi.gr/jspui/bitstream/123456789/6116/1/13.%20%CE%97%20%CF%81%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%8A%CE%BA%CE%AE%20%CE%B1%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B1.pdf] D.
