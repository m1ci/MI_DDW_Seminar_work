The present-day location is the hill of [[Hisarlik]] and its immediate vicinity. In modern scholarly nomenclature, the Ridge of Troy (including Hisarlik) borders the Plain of Troy, flat agricultural land, which conducts the lower [[Karamenderes River|Scamander River]] to the strait. Troy was the setting of the [[Trojan War]] described in the Greek [[Epic Cycle]], in particular in the ''[[Iliad]]'', one of the two epic poems attributed to [[Homer]]. [[metre (poetry)|Metrical]] evidence from the ''Iliad'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' suggests that the name {{lang|grc|·ººŒªŒπŒøŒΩ}} (''Ilion'') formerly began with a [[digamma]]: {{lang|grc|œúŒØŒªŒπŒøŒΩ}} (''Wilion'');&lt;ref name=met group=note/&gt; this is also supported by the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] name for what is thought to be the same city, [[Wilusa]].

A new capital called '''Ilium''' (from Greek: ·ººŒªŒπŒøŒΩ, ''Ilion'') was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric and declined gradually in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], but is now a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

In 1865, English archaeologist [[Frank Calvert]] excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlik, and in 1868, [[Heinrich Schliemann]], a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist, also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in [[√áanakkale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=54‚Äì55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=A≈ükin |first=Mustafa |title=Troy |year=1981 |publisher=Keskin |location=Istanbul |edition=2005 rev |page=[https://archive.org/details/troywithlegendsf00aski/page/34 34] |isbn=978-975-7559-37-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/troywithlegendsf00aski/page/34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These excavations revealed several cities built in succession.

== Homeric Troy ==
{{Further|Homeric Question|Historicity of the Iliad|Troy VII}}
[[File:Troas.png|thumb|Map of the Troad, including the site of Troy]]
Ancient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th, 13th, or 14th centuries BC: [[Eratosthenes]] to 1184&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Herodotus]] to 1250&amp;nbsp;BC, and [[Duris of Samos]] to 1334&amp;nbsp;BC. The major school of modern classical archaeology associates Homeric Troy with archaeological [[Troy VII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] set up their camp near the mouth of the River [[Scamander]] (modern [[Karamenderes]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;ShopesHamilton2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cenker|first1=I≈üil Cerem|last2=Thys-≈ûenocak|first2=Lucienne|editor=Shopes, Linda |editor2=Hamilton, Paula|title=Oral History and Public Memories|year=2008|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-59213-141-9|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they beached their ships. The city of Troy itself stood on a hill, across the plain of Scamander, where the battles of the Trojan War took place. The site of the ancient city is some 5&amp;nbsp;km from the coast today, but 3,000 years ago the mouths of Scamander were much closer to the city,&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' XIII, I, 36, tr. H. L. Jones, Loeb Classical Library; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', V.33, tr. H. Rackham, W. S. Jones and D. E. Eichholz, Loeb Classical Library.&lt;/ref&gt; discharging into a large bay that formed a natural harbor, which has since been filled with [[alluvial]] material. Recent geological findings have permitted the identification of the ancient Trojan coastline, and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2736059.stm |title=Geologists investigate Trojan battlefield |date=7 February 2003 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, the geologist John C. Kraft from the [[University of Delaware]] and the classicist [[John V. Luce]] from [[Trinity College, Dublin]], presented the results of investigations, begun in 1977, into the geology of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001AM/finalprogram/abstract_25431.htm |title=Bronze Age Paleogeographies at Ancient Troy |last=Kraft |first=John C. |year=2001 |publisher=[[Geological Society of America]] |access-date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the ''Iliad'' and other classical sources, notably [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica|Geographia]]'', and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann's Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp, the geological evidence, descriptions of the [[topography]] and accounts of the battle in the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ball&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2003/030129/full/news030127-4.html |title=Geologists show Homer got it right |last=Ball |first=Philip |date=29 January 2003 |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |access-date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/2/163 Harbor areas at ancient Troy: Sedimentology and geomorphology complement Homer's Iliad], Geoscience World (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2003/troy030303.html |title=Press Release: Geology corresponds with Homer's description of ancient Troy|publisher=University of Delaware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the ''Iliad'', there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer, the ''[[Odyssey]]'', as well as in other ancient Greek literature (such as [[Aeschylus]]'s [[The Oresteia|Oresteia]]). The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''. The Greeks and Romans took for a fact the [[Historicity of the Iliad|historicity of the Trojan War]] and the identity of Homeric Troy with the site in Anatolia. [[Alexander the Great]], for example, visited the site in 334&amp;nbsp;BC and there made sacrifices at tombs associated with the Homeric heroes [[Achilles]] and [[Patroclus]]. In [[Piri Reis]] book ''Kitab-ƒ± Bahriye'' (Book of the Sea, 1521) which details many ports and islands of the Mediterranean, the description of the island called Tenedos mentions Troy and it ruins, lying on the shore opposite of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reis|first1=Piri|title=Kitab-ƒ± Bahriye|year=2013|publisher=Boyut|isbn=9789752310513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 discovery of a [[Luwian]] biconvex seal at Troy VII sparked heated debate over the [[Trojan language|language that was spoken in Homeric Troy]]. Frank Starke of the [[University of T√ºbingen]] has recently argued that the name of [[Priam]], king of Troy at the time of the [[Trojan War]], is related to the Luwian compound ''Priimuua'', which means &quot;exceptionally courageous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Starke |first=Frank |title=Troia im Kontext des historisch-politischen und sprachlichen Umfeldes Kleinasiens im 2. Jahrtausend |journal=Studia Troica |year=1997 |volume=7 |pages=447‚Äì87}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community,&quot; although it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or in daily colloquial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these ideas may be some what politically driven as Trojans had greek names and worshipped greek gods and if are to believe the romans who believed their ancestors migrated to italy as refugees from troy, it would support that Troy was indeed a greco roman --ionian greek state...linguistics and basic archaeology in the area would confirm this...

== Search for Troy ==
[[File:Alexandria Troas Thermen.JPG|thumb|200px|Alexandria Troas]]
With the rise of critical history, Troy and the Trojan War were, for a long time, consigned to the realms of legend. However, the true location of ancient Troy had from [[Classical antiquity|classical]] times remained the subject of interest and speculation.

The [[Troad]] peninsula was anticipated to be the location. Early modern travellers in the 16th and 17th centuries, including [[Pierre Belon]] and [[Pietro Della Valle]], had identified Troy with [[Alexandria Troas]], a ruined town approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km south of the currently accepted location.{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|p=184}} In the late 18th century, [[Jean Baptiste LeChevalier]] had identified a location near the village of [[:tr:Pƒ±narba≈üƒ±, Ezine|Pƒ±narba≈üƒ±, Ezine]] as the site of Troy, a mound approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km south of the currently accepted location. LeChavalier's location, published in his ''Voyage de la Troade'', was the most commonly accepted theory for almost a century.{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|pp=184‚Äì191}}

In 1822, the Scottish journalist [[Charles Maclaren]] was the first to identify with confidence the position of the city as it is now known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maclaren|first1=Charles|title=A Dissertation On the Topography of the Plain of Troy: Including an Examination of the Opinions of Demetrius, Chevalier, Dr. Clarke, and Major Rennell|year=1822|publisher=Bibliobazaar|isbn=978-1-146-73161-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UkkMAAAAYAAJ|access-date=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schliemann|1881|p=189}}

=== Calvert ===
[[File:Frank calvert portrait-png.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Frank Calvert]]
In 1866, [[Frank Calvert]], the brother of the United States' [[Consul|consular agent]] in the region, made extensive surveys and published in scholarly journals his identification of the hill of New Ilium (which was on farmland owned by his family) on the same site. The hill, near the city of [[√áanakkale]], was known as Hisarlik.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|pp=42‚Äì44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat, considered a pioneer for the contributions he made to the archaeology of Troy, spent more than 60 years in the Troad (modern day [[Biga, √áanakkale|Biga]] peninsula, Turkey) conducting field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Calvert was a principal authority on field archaeology in the region, his findings supplied evidence that Homeric Troy might have existed on the hill, and played a major role in convincing Heinrich Schliemann to dig at Hisarlik.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=380}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schliemann ===
{{off topic|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1878) b 713.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Heinrich Schliemann]]
In 1868, German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] visited Calvert and secured permission to excavate [[Hisarlik]]. At the time the field of archaeology was a new one. Previous &quot;archaeologists&quot; had no science of archaeology to guide them, but more often than not, bored straight to where they believed the contents of the mound were, removed the contents,  and publicised their findings as &quot;hidden treasure.&quot; Schliemann exploited this type of showmanship as a means of drawing attention to his work. He sincerely believed that the literary events of the works of Homer could be verified archaeologically.

His education in the developing field of archaeology was rapid. He advertised for a wife whose skills and interest were on a par with his own, Sophie. He always consulted with other persons more experienced than he, such as Calvert, and later with many more archaeologists now considered co-founders of the field of archaeology. He spared no expense to obtain the resources and rights to excavate. He became in fact a pioneer of archaeology, but he was troubled even in his own time by allegations impugning his honesty and credibility. These continue today as a type of scandal-mongering. Nevertheless his scheme of city-layers has been adopted and remains a cornerstone of the field. Though barred for a time from Troy by the Turkish government for his unauthorized removal of artifacts (the treasure), he accepted monitoring by the Greek government for his excavations in Greece and was never proved to be complicit in any fraud. 

[[File:Sophia schliemann.gif|thumb|Sophia Schliemann wearing the &quot;Jewels of Helen,&quot; a famed piece in the Priam's Treasure collection.]]
In 1871‚Äì73 and 1878‚Äì79, he excavated the hill and discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the Roman period. Schliemann declared one of these cities‚Äîat first Troy I, later Troy II‚Äîto be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time. Some of Schliemann's portable finds at Hisarlik have become known as [[Priam's Treasure]], an extension of his own use of the term to include a smaller assemblage of artifacts of precious metal, such as the jewelry seen displayed on Sophie. In subsequent decades various conspiracy theories have been presented questioning their authenticity. Such theories have Heinrich making a secret pact with a goldsmith to devise plausible articles, to be planted by Heinrich and Sophie sneaking around the dark trenches at night without a light to avoid attention, and surviving the experience without breaking their limbs, to present them as genuine the next day. No such suspicions were made public at the time. The artifacts were acquired from him by the [[Museum Island|Berlin museums]].

Schliemann became interested in the mound of Hisarlik as the site of Troy at the persuasion of [[Frank Calvert]]. Calvert invited and enabled Schliemann to conduct an excavation at Troy, rather than doing it himself. Nevertheless a leading Schliemann critic of the latter 20th century, Susan Heuck Allen, in a 1999 book, has accused Schliemann of taking Calvert's ideas and casting him into the shadow: &quot;Schliemann's self-aggrandizement cast into the shadow a man whose claim to having discovered Troy is just as strong, if not stronger: Frank Calvert.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1999|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvert made no claim to have discovered Troy; such a theory is Heuck's idea. If &quot;discover&quot; means &quot;prove by excavation,&quot; that is a task Calvert invited Schliemann to perform. Allen's critique is only one of an anti-Schliemann school of thought. Some archaeologists have asserted that Schliemann destroyed the main layers of Troy. [[Kenneth W. Harl]] in the Teaching Company's ''Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor'' lecture series sarcastically claims that Schliemann's excavations were carried out with such rough methods that he did to Troy what the Achaeans had been unable to do: destroy and level the city walls completely to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/11/06/german-archaeologist-and-businessman-blew-up-entire-9-levels-of-archaeological-the-remains-of-historical-troy-with-dynamite/| title=German Archaeologist and Businessman blew up entire 9 levels of Archaeological the remains of Historical Troy with Dynamite | author=Ian Harvey | date=6 November 2016 | website=The Vintage News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This jest takes considerable license, as portions of nine city walls are still in evidence. Acrimonious recriminations of this sort are common in the field of classical archaeology. There is no doubt that in the late 19th century a professional 20th-century archaeologist with the tools of modern science would have done better, but none was then available.

=== D√∂rpfeld and Blegen ===
[[File:Doerpfeld2.jpg|thumb|100px|Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld]]
[[File:Carl Blegen in 1922.jpg|thumb|100px|Carl Blegen]]
After Schliemann, the site was further excavated under the direction of [[Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld]] {{nowrap|(1893‚Äì94)}} and later [[Carl Blegen]] (1932‚Äì38). They each wrote books publishing their excvations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Wilhelm | last=D√∂rpfeld | title=Troja und Ilion | publisher=Beck &amp; Barth | year=1902}}, {{cite book | first=Carl W. | last=Blegen | title=Troy; excavations conducted by the University of Cincinnati, 1932‚Äì1938 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; These archaeologists, though following Schliemann's lead, added a professional approach not available to Schliemann. Their excavations have shown that there were at least nine cities built, one on top of the other, at this site. In his research, Blegen came to a conclusion that Troy's nine levels could be further divided into forty-six sublevels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korfmann ===
In 1988, excavations were resumed by a team from the University of T√ºbingen and the [[University of Cincinnati]] under the direction of Professor [[Manfred Korfmann]], with Professor [[C. Brian Rose|Brian Rose]] overseeing Post-Bronze Age (Greek, Roman, Byzantine) excavation along the coast of the Aegean Sea at the Bay of Troy. Possible evidence of a battle was found in the form of bronze arrowheads and fire-damaged human remains buried in layers dated to the early 12th century BC. The question of Troy's status in the Bronze-Age world has been the subject of a sometimes acerbic debate between Korfmann and the T√ºbingen historian [[Frank Kolb]] in 2001‚Äì2002.

Korfmann proposed that the location of the city (close to the [[Dardanelles]]) indicated a commercially oriented city that would have been at the center of a vibrant trade between the Black Sea, Aegean, Anatolian and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Kolb disputed this thesis, calling it &quot;unfounded&quot; in a 2004 paper. He argues that archaeological evidence shows that economic trade during the [[Late Bronze Age]] was quite limited in the Aegean region compared with later periods in antiquity. On the other hand, the Eastern Mediterranean economy was more active during this time, allowing for commercial cities to develop only in the [[Levant]]. Kolb also noted the lack of evidence for trade with the [[Hittite Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kolb |first1= F.|date=2004 |title=Forum Article: Troy VI: A Trading Center and Commercial City? |url= |journal=American Journal of Archaeology American Journal of Archaeology |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages= 577‚Äì613|jstor=40025731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1993, following a magnetic imaging survey of the fields below the fort, a deep ditch was located and excavated among the ruins of a later Greek and Roman city. Remains found in the ditch were dated to the late Bronze Age, the alleged time of Homeric Troy. Among these remains are arrowheads and charred remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ten Discoveries That Rewrote History|last=Hunt|first=Patrick|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Modern Excavations at Troy Continue to Show Its Importance}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed by Korfmann that the ditch may have once marked the outer defenses of a much larger city than had previously been suspected. In the olive groves surrounding the citadel, there are portions of land that were difficult to plow, suggesting that there are undiscovered portions of the city lying there. The latter city has been dated by his team to about 1250&amp;nbsp;BC, and it has been also suggested‚Äîbased on recent archeological evidence uncovered by Professor Manfred Korfmann's team‚Äîthat this was indeed the Homeric city of Troy.

=== Becker ===
[[Helmut Becker]] utilized magnetometry in the area surrounding Hisarlik. He was conducting an excavation in 1992 to locate outer walls of the ancient city. Becker used a caesium magnetometer. In he and his team's search, they discovered a &quot;'burnt mudbrick wall' about 400 metres south of the Troy VI fortress wall.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Troy and Homer: Towards a Solution of an Old Mystery|last=Latacz|first=Joachim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After dating their find, it was deemed to have been from the late Bronze Age, which would put it either in Troy VI or early Troy VII. This discovery of an outer wall away from the tell proves that Troy could have housed many more inhabitants than Schliemann originally thought.

=== Recent developments ===
In summer 2006, the excavations continued under the direction of Korfmann's colleague Ernst Pernicka, with a new digging permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de//uni/aft/|title=Project Troia|publisher=[[University of T√ºbingen]], [[University of Cincinnati]]|access-date=6 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526125407/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/aft/|archivedate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an international team made up of cross-disciplinary experts led by William Aylward, an archaeologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was to carry out new excavations. This activity was to be conducted under the auspices of [[√áanakkale Onsekiz Mart University]] and was to use the new technique of &quot;molecular archaeology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/21160 |title=UW-Madison archaeologists to mount new expedition to Troy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before the Wisconsin team was to leave, Turkey cancelled about 100 excavation permits, including Wisconsin's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simmons |first=Dan |title=UW-Madison archaeology trip to Troy postponed until next summer |url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/education/university/uw-madison-archaeology-trip-to-troy-postponed-until-next-summer/article_2bf073da-cee6-53c9-9bc1-15fdc2905712.html |access-date=6 May 2014 |newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal |date=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, it was announced that a new excavation would take place to be sponsored by a private company and carried out by √áanakkale Onsekiz Mart University. This will be the first Turkish team to excavate and is planned as a 12-month excavation led by associate professor R√ºstem Aslan. The University's rector stated that &quot;Pieces unearthed in Troy will contribute to √áanakkale‚Äôs culture and tourism. Maybe it will become one of Turkey‚Äôs most important frequented historical places.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=√áanakkale&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Dogan News Agency|title=New term excavations start at city of Troy with Turkish team|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/new-term-excavations-start-at-city-of-troy-with-turkish-team.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=63540&amp;NewsCatID=375|website=hurriyetdailynews.com|publisher=Hurriyet daily News|accessdate=28 December 2014|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Troy Historical National Park ==
The Turkish government created the Historical National Park at Troy on September 30, 1996. It contains {{convert|136|km2|sqmi}} to include Troy and its vicinity, centered on Troy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Historical National Park Of Troy | url=https://www.troyexcavations.com/troia-tarihi-milli-parki/?l=en | publisher=Ministry of Culture and Tourism | accessdate=1 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the park is to protect the historical sites and monuments within it, as well as the ecology of the region. In 1998 the park was accepted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In 2015 a Term Development Revision Plan was applied to the park. Its intent was to develop the park into a major tourist site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Troy National Park to be renovated | journal=Daily Sabah | date=30 October 2015 | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/life/2015/10/30/troy-national-park-to-be-renovated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans included marketing research to determine the features most of interest to the public, the training of park personnel in tourism management, and the construction of campsites and facilites for those making day trips. These latter were concentrated in the village of Tevfikiye, which shares Troy Ridge with Troy.

== Troy as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ==
The archaeological site of Troy was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] list in 1998.

For a site to be named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it must be claimed to have Outstanding Universal Value. This means that it must be historically, culturally, or scientifically significant to all peoples of the world in some manner. According to the UNESCO site on Troy, its historical significance was gained because the site displays some of the &quot;first contact between...Anatolia and the Mediterranean world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849/|title=Archaeological Site of Troy|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's cultural significance is gained from the multitudes of literature regarding the famed city and history over centuries. Many of the structures dating to the Bronze Age and the Roman and Greek periods are still standing at Hisarlik. These give archeological significance to the site as well. 

More information on the UNESCO qualifications of Troy can be found on the [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849/ UNESCO website].

== Troy Museum ==
[[File:Troy Museum 9913.jpg|thumb|200px|Troy Museum aboveground. Most of the entire field in which it sits roofs the underground galleries, work, and storage spaces. These are accessed via ramps not shown. There are also outdoor display spaces.]]
In 2018 the [[Troy Museum]] (Turkish Troya M√ºzesi) was opened at Tevfikiye village {{convert|800|m|yards}}  east of the excavation. A design contest for the architecture had been won by Yalin Mimarlik in 2011. The cube-shaped building with extensive underground galleries holds more than 40,000 portable artifacts, 2000 of which are on display. Artifacts were moved here from a few other former museums in the region. The range is the entire prehistoric Troad. Displays are multi-lingual. In may cases the original contexts are reproduced.

== Fortifications of the city ==
[[File:Troy (Ilion), Turkey (7446656654).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Artist's representation of fortifications at Troy]]
Literary Troy was characterized by high walls and towers, summarized by the epithet &quot;lofty Ilium.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Ilium | editor=William Smith | encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | year=2020 | origyear=1854 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DI%3Aentry+group%3D3%3Aentry%3Dilium-geo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other epithets were &quot;well-walled,&quot; &quot;with lofty gates,&quot; &quot;with fine towers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blegen's study of the Homeric epithets bearing on the architecture of Troy may be found at {{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any archaeological candidate for being the literary city would therefore have to show evidence for the walls and towers. Schliemann's Troy fits this qualification very well. High walls and towers are in evidence at every hand. Hissarlik, the name of the hill on which Troy is situated, is Turkish for &quot;the fortress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walls of Troy, first erected in the Bronze Age between at least 3000 and 2600 BC, were its main defense, as is true of almost any ancient city of urban size. Whether Troy Zero featured walls is not yet known. Some of the known walls were placed on virgin soil (see the archaeology section below). The early date of the walls suggests that defense was important and warfare was a looming possibility right from the beginning.

The walls surround the citadel, extending for several hundred meters, and at the time they were built were over {{convert|17|feet|m|lk=on}} tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Troy-ancient-city-Turkey|title=Troy|last=the Editors of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|date=November 22, 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made of limestone, with watchtowers and brick ramparts, or elevated mounds that served as protective barriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The second run of excavations, under Korfmann, revealed that the walls of the first run were not the entire suite of walls for the city, and only partially represent the citadel. According to Korfmann, &quot;There was also a lower city that went with the Late Bronze Age Troja,...1750-1200 BCE.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korfmass|2003|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This city had a perimeter 0f {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} end enclosed an area 16 times that of the citadel. It was protected by a ditch surmounted by a wall of mud brick and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the citadel walls were surmounted by structures of mud brick. The stone part of the walls currently in evidence were &quot;...five meters thick and at least eight meters high - and over that a mudbrick superstructure several meters high...,&quot; which totals to about {{convert|15|m|ft}} for the citadel walls at about the time of the Trojan War. The present-day walls of Troy, then, portray little of the ancient city's appearance, any more than bare foundations characterize a building.

What Schliemann actually found as he excavated the hill of Hissarlik somewhat haphazardly were contexts in the soil parallel to the contexts of geologic layers in rock. Exposed rock displays layers of a similar composition and fossil content within a layer discontinuous with other layers above and below it. The layer represents an accumulation of detritus over a continuous time, different from the times of the other layers.

Similarly Schliemann found layers of distinctive soil each containing more or less distinctive artifacts differing often markedly from other layers. He had no ready explanation for the discontinuity between layers, such as &quot;destruction,&quot; although this interpretation has sometimes been applied. Presumably &quot;destruction&quot; is to be interpreted to mean some sort of malicious event perpetrated by humans or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake. In most cases no such disaster can be proved. On the contrary, the &quot;many layers illustrate the gradual development of civilization in northwestern Asia Minor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The view presented by Encyclopedia Britannica is self-contradictory, the reason being that different sources place different interpretations on archaeological layering. To some, layers represent new peoples sweeping in and destroying the old population centers, to place their own settlements there. Such dramatic events do sometimes happen. Archaeologists of the late 19th and early 20th century tended to adopt this &quot;invasion&quot; view, but later it became evident that in most cases invasions were mainly speculative. The evidence usually supported no such thing. The tendency today is to look for slow transitions from one culture to another in the same region. Other statements in the Britannica article support this view. The best example is &quot;the search for Troy;&quot; that is, the long effort to identify any evidence of the historical destruction of Troy. If this most obvious question cannot be settled, then destructions for every layer are less likely.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discontinuities of culture in different layers might be explained in a number of ways. A settlement might have been abandoned for peaceful reasons, or it might have undergone a renovation phase. These are hypotheses that must be ruled in or ruled out by evidence, or simply be left unruled until evidence should be discovered.

What Schliemann found is that the area now called &quot;the citadel&quot; or &quot;the upper city&quot; was apparently placed on virgin soil. It was protected by fortifications right from the start. The layering effect was caused in part by the placement of new fortifications and new houses over the old. Schliemann called these fortified enclosures &quot;cities&quot; (rightly or wrongly). In his mind the site was composed of successive cities. Like everyone else, he speculated whether a new city represented a different population, and what its relationship to the old was. He numbered the cities I, II, etc., I being on the bottom. Subsequent archaeologists turned the &quot;cities&quot; into layers (rightly or wrongly), named according to the new archaeological naming conventions then being developed. 
The layers of ruins in the citadel at [[Hisarlik]] are numbered Troy I{{spaced ndash}}Troy IX, with various subdivisions.

{{side box | above='''The Layers of Troy''' | image=[[File:Layers of Troy.JPG|thumb|350px|center|In this photograph, depicting &quot;the Schliemann trench,&quot; different layers have been identified by sign for the convenience of the visitors.]]}}

Until the late 20th century, these layers represented only the layers on the hill of Hisarlik. Archaeologists following Schliemann picked up the trail of his researches adopting the same fundamental assumptions, culminating in the work and writings of [[Carl Blegen]] in the mid-20th century. In a definitive work, ''Troy and the Trojans'', he summarized the layers names and the dates he had adopted for them.&lt;ref name=bleg174&gt;{{harvnb|Blegen|1995|p=174}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without further excavation, Blegen's was the last word. There were, however, some persistent criticisms not answered to general satisfaction. Hisarlik, about the size of a football field, was not large enough to have been the mighty city of history. It was also far inland, yet the general historical tradition suggested it must have been close to the sea.

The issues finally devolved on the necessity for further excavation, which was undertaken by Korfmann starting 1988. He concentrated on the Roman city, which was not suspected as being over Bronze Age remains. A Bronze Age city, at low elevations, was discovered beneath it. As it is unlikely that there were two Troys side by side, the lower city must have been the main seat of residence, to which the upper city served as citadel. Korfman now referred to the layers of the lower city as associated with the layers of the citadel. The same layering scheme was applicable. The lower city was many times the size of the citadel, answering the size objection. 

[[File:Troja-Blick-Schliemanngraben.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The view from Hisarlƒ±k across the plain of Ilium to the [[Aegean Sea]]. During the early Troy periods, nearly this entire plain was an inlet of the sea. Troy was a maritime city.]]
Meanwhile independent geoarchaeological research conducted by taking ground cores over a wide area of the Troad were demonstrating that, in the time of Troy I, &quot;... the sea was right at the foot of 'Schliemann's Trench' during the earliest periods of Troja.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1=Ernst Pernicka | editor2=Charles Brian Rose | editor3=Peter Jablonka | first=Ilhan | last=Kayan | chapter=Geoarchaeological Record at Troja and Its Environs | title=Troia 1987‚Äì2012: Grabungen und Forschungen I, Forschungsgeschichte, Methoden und Landschaft | series=Studia Troica Monographien 5 | location=Bonn | publisher=Verlag Dr. Rudolf Habelt GMBH | volume=Teil 2 | page=714 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9aaa/eb8a0f787f349cf119c94e742c4d4dbaea54.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few thousand years earlier the ridge of Troy was partly surrounded by an inlet of the sea occupying the now agricultural area of the lower Scamander River. Troy was founded as an apparently maritime city on the shore of this inlet, which persisted throughout the early layers and was present to a lesser degree, farther away, subsequently. The current water table depends on the degree of irrigation of the now agricultural lands. Trench flooding has slowed investigation of the lower levels in the lower city.

The whole course of archaeological investigation at Troy has resulted in no single chronological table of layers. Moreover, due to limitations on the accuracy of C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; dating, the tables remain relative; i.e., absolute, or calendar dates, cannot be precisely assigned. In regions of the Earth where both history and C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; dating are available, there is often a gap between them, termed by Renfrew a chronological or archaeological &quot;fault line.&quot; The two models, historical and archaeological, do not correspond, just as the contexts on either side of a geologic fault line do not correspond. &quot;This line divides all Europe except the Aegean from the Near East.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Jak | last=Yakar | title=Troy and Anatolia Early Bronze Age Chronology | journal=Anatolian Studies | volume=29 | year=1979 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Table of layers ===
[[File:Section Troy-Hisarlik-de.svg|thumb|300px|left|Representation of a cross-section of the mound of Hissarlik showing the relationship between the fortifications and the layers.]]
The table below concentrates on two systems of dates: Blegen's from ''Troy and the Trojans'',&lt;ref name=bleg174/&gt;, representing the last of the trend from Schliemann to the mid-20th century, and Korfmann's, from ''Troia in Light of New Research'' in the early years of the 21st century, after he had had a chance to establish a new trend and new excavations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korfmann|2003|pp=32-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to Korfmann's excavations, the nine-layer model was considered comprehensive of all the material at Troy. Korfmann discovered that the city was not placed on virgin soil, as Schliemann had concluded. There is no reason not to think that, in the areas he tested, Schliemann did find that Troy I was on virgin soil. Korfmann discovered a layer previous to Troy I under a gate to Troy II. He dated it 3500 BC to 2920 BC, but did not assign a name. The current director of excavation at Troy, R√ºstem Aslan, is calling it Troy 0 (zero).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ancient city of Troy likely founded 600 years earlier than thought | website=Daily Sabah History | location=Istanbul | date=9 January 2019 | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2019/08/21/ancient-city-of-troy-likely-founded-600-years-earlier-than-thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman numerals have no zero, but zero is one number less than I. 

Troy 0 has been omitted from the table below, due to the uncertainty of its general status. Archaeologists at the site before Korfmann had thought that Troy I began with the Bronze Age at 3000 BC. Troy zero is before this date. The remains of the layer are not very substantial. Whether the layer is to be counted as part of the preceding Chalcolithic, or whether the dates of the Bronze Age are to be changed, has not been decided through the regular channel of journal articles. One 2016 PhD Thesis complained: &quot;... the stratigraphic sequence of the renewed excavations is presented differently by different collaborators of Korfmann ... So, until an agreed stratigraphy of Korfmann‚Äôs cycle is published, the employment of Troy as a yardstick for the whole of the Anatolian EBA remains problematic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | last=Massa |first=Michele  | year=2016 |title=Networks before Empires: cultural transfers in west and central Anatolia during the Early Bronze Age |type=PhD | location=London| publisher=Institute of Archaeology University College |url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1478344/43/Massa_Thesis_combined.pdf |access-date=23 January 2020 | page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Not long after the beginning of the new excavations, Rose, anticipating that the dates were going to change, published some new chronological boundaries for Troy VIII-IX: {{cite book | first=C.B. | last=Rose | chapter=The 1991 Post-Bronze Age excavations at Troia | title=Studia Troica | volume=2 | year=1992 | page=44 n. 16}} This article prefers the dates published by Korfmann after his excavations had had more of a chance to mature. Unforunately a final solidification and publication was prevented by his untimely death of natural causes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Korfmann also found that Troy IX was not the end of the settlements. Regardless of whether the city was abandoned at 450 AD, a population was back for the Middle Ages, which, for those times, was under the Byzantine Empire. As with Troy Zero, no conventional scholarly classification has been tested in the journals. The literature mentions Troy X, and even Troy XI, without solid definition. The table below therefore omits them.
&lt;!-- The main divisions are given below.The old question remains, what was the relationship of Troy I to Troy II, etc.? It is not as simple as the replacement of one assemblage with another. Some artifacts were not replaced. The study of what artifacts were or were not replaced and under what conditions is now a major one. --&gt;

=== Troy I‚ÄìV ===
The first city on the site was founded in the 3rd millennium BC. During the [[Bronze Age]], the site seems to have been a flourishing mercantile city, since its location allowed for complete control of the [[Dardanelles]], through which every merchant ship from the [[Aegean Sea]] heading for the [[Black Sea]] had to pass. Cities to the east of Troy were destroyed, and although Troy was not burned, the next period shows a change of culture indicating a new people had taken over Troy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellaart&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/500459 |last=Mellaart |first=James |date=January 1958 |title=The end of the early Bronze Age in Anatolia and the Aegean |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=9‚Äì33 |jstor=500459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the city is characterized by a smaller citadel, around 300&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter, with 20 rectangular houses surrounded by massive walls, towers, and gateways.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Troy II doubled in size and had a lower town and the upper citadel, with the walls protecting the upper acropolis which housed the [[megaron]]-style palace for the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard T.|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2012|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase was destroyed by a large fire, but the Trojans rebuilt, creating a fortified citadel larger than Troy II, but which had smaller and more condensed houses, suggesting an economic decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This trend of making a larger circuit, or extent of the walls, continued with each rebuild, for Troy III, IV, and V. Therefore, even in the face of economic troubles, the walls remained as elaborate as before, indicating their focus on defense and protection.

==== Schliemann's Troy II ====
When Schliemann came across Troy II, in 1871, he believed he had found Homer's city. Schliemann and his team unearthed a large feature he dubbed the Scaean Gate, a western gate unlike the three previously found leading to the Pergamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gate, as he describes, was the gate that Homer had featured. As Schliemann states in his publication ''Troja'':
&quot;I have proved that in a remote antiquity there was in the plain of Troy a large city, destroyed of old by a fearful catastrophe, which had on the hill of Hisarlƒ±k only its Acropolis with its temples and a few other large edifices, southerly, and westerly direction on the site of the later Ilium; and that, consequently, this city answers perfectly to the Homeric description of the sacred site of Ilios.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schliemann|1881|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;Also, he uncovered what he referred to as The Palace of Priam, after the king during the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Troy and Its Remains|last=Schliemann|first=Heinrich|publisher=Benjamin Blom, Inc.|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reference is incorrect because Priam lived nearly a thousand years after Troy II.

=== Troy VI and VII ===
{{Main|Troy VII}}
Troy VI was destroyed around 1250 BC, probably by an [[earthquake]]. Only a single arrowhead was found in this layer, and no remains of bodies. However, the town quickly recovered and was rebuilt in a layout that was more orderly. This rebuild continued the trend of having a heavily fortified citadel to preserve the outer rim of the city in the face of earthquakes and sieges of the central city.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Troy VI can be characterized by the construction of the pillars at the south gate. There appears to be no structural use for the pillars. The pillars have an altar-like base and an impressive magnitude. This provides some clues, and they most likely were used as a symbol for the religious cults of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=W. F. J.|date=1934|title=The Pillars at the South Gate of Troy VI|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=54|issue=2|pages=210|doi=10.2307/626868|issn=0075-4269|jstor=626868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another characterizing feature of Troy VI is the tightly packed housing near the Citadel and construction of many cobble streets. Although only few homes could be uncovered, this is due to reconstruction of Troy VIIa over the tops of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablonka|first=Peter|last2=Rose|first2=C.

Also, discovered in 1890, in this layer of Troy VI was Mycenaean pottery. This pottery suggests that during Troy IV, the Trojans still had trade with the Greeks and the Aegean. Furthermore, there were cremation burials discovered 400m south of the citadel wall. This provided evidence of a small lower city south of the Hellenistic city walls. Although the size of this city is unknown due to erosion and regular building activities, there is significant evidence that was uncovered by Blegen in 1953 during an excavation of the site. This evidence included settlements just above bedrock and a ditch thought to be used for defense. Furthermore, the small settlement itself, south of the wall, could have also been used as an obstacle to defend the main city walls and the citadel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easton|first=D.F.|last2=Hawkins|first2=J.D.|last3=Sherratt|first3=A.G.|last4=Sherratt|first4=E.S.|date=December 2002|title=Troy in recent perspective|journal=Anatolian Studies|volume=52|pages=75‚Äì109|doi=10.2307/3643078|issn=0066-1546|jstor=3643078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic still under debate is whether Troy was primarily an Anatolian-oriented or Aegean-oriented metropolis. While it is true that the city would have had a presence in the Aegean,  pottery finds and architecture strongly hint at an Anatolian orientation. Only about one percent of the pottery discovered during excavation of Troy VI was Mycenaean. The large walls and gates of the city are closely related to many other Anatolian designs. Furthermore, the practice of cremation is Anatolian. Cremation is never seen in the Mycenaean world. Anatolian hieroglyphic writing along with bronze seals marked with Anatolian hieroglyphic Luwian were also uncovered in 1995. These seals have been seen in approximately 20 other Anatolian and Syrian cities from the time (1280 - 1175 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Korfmann 1998 369&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korfmann|first=Manfred|date=1998|title=Troia, an Ancient Anatolian Palatial and Trading Center: Archaeological Evidence for the Period of Troia VI/VII|journal=The Classical World|volume=91|issue=5|pages=369‚Äì385|doi=10.2307/4352105|issn=0009-8418|jstor=4352105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, Troy VI was dominated by long distance trade. Troy VI during the height of its establishment held anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 people. At its time, Troy would have been a large and significant city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korfmann 1998 369&quot;/&gt; The location of Troy was extremely practical in the Early Bronze Age (2000‚Äì1500 BC). It acted as a middle ground for long distance trade with regions as far distant as Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, the Baltic region, Egypt, and the western Mediterranean in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages.  Earlier trade connections during the Early and Middle Bronze Ages provided Troy VI with favorable power in the long distance trade industry of the region. The amount of objects thought to be going through Troy VI would have been quite large, obtaining metals from the east and various objects from the west including perfumes and oils. This is known due to the findings of hundreds of shipwrecks off the Turkish coast. Found in these ships was an abundance of goods. Some of these ships carried over 15 tons in goods. The goods discovered in these wrecks included copper ingots, tin ingots, glass ingots, bronze tools and weapons, ebony and ivory, ostrich egg shells, jewelry and large amounts of pottery from across the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolb 577‚Äì613&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolb|first=Frank|date=October 2004|title=Troy VI: A Trading Center and Commercial City?|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=108|issue=4|pages=577‚Äì613|doi=10.3764/aja.108.4.577|issn=0002-9114}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;

There have been 210 shipwrecks discovered in the Mediterranean from the Bronze Age. Of these 210, 63 were discovered off the Turkish coastline. This provides a great deal of evidence for Troy VI being a prominent trading center for the region. But, the evidence at the site of Troy itself is minimal. Looking at the layers of Troy VI, we discover that there is little documentation of the excavation of this layer, and little documentation of the goods discovered in this layer. We also know that there were few trading centers during the Late Bronze Age. This is due to the low volume of trade during this period. The trading centers would have most likely been directly along trade routes. Troy is just north of most major long-distance trade routes. It may be unfair to classify Troy VI as a trading center but we do know that Troy VI was a prominent metropolis that did contribute to the trade of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolb 577‚Äì613&quot;/&gt;

Troy VIIa can be highlighted by most of the population of Troy moving within the walls of the Citadel. This is most likely due to the threat from the Mycenaeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=Charles Brian|date=1998|title=Troy and the Historical Imagination|journal=The Classical World|volume=91|issue=5|pages=405‚Äì413|doi=10.2307/4352107|issn=0009-8418|jstor=4352107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troy VI is believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake. This would not have been uncommon. Earthquakes are common throughout the region. Troy VIIa is believed to be built over the ruined Troy VI, which makes the excavation process of Troy difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=Denys|date=September 1953|title=The City of Troy|journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=8|issue=31|pages=85‚Äì86|doi=10.2307/3887022|issn=0038-1969|jstor=3887022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troy VIIa, which has been dated to the mid-to-late-13th century BC, is the most often cited candidate for the Troy of Homer. Troy VIIa appears to have been destroyed by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bauer|2007|pp=253‚Äì58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of fire and slaughter around 1184 BC, which brought Troy VIIa to a close, led to this phase being identified with the city besieged by the Greeks during the Trojan War. This was immortalized in the ''[[Iliad]]'' written by Homer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/849 |title=Archaeological Site of Troy&amp;nbsp;‚Äì UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=1998-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Calvert's Thousand-Year Gap ====
Initially, the layers of Troy VI and VII were overlooked entirely, because Schliemann favoured the burnt city of Troy II. It was not until the need to close &quot;Calvert's Thousand Year Gap&quot; arose‚Äîfrom D√∂rpfeld's discovery of Troy VI‚Äîthat archaeology turned away from Schliemann's Troy and began working towards finding Homeric Troy once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Calvert's Thousand Year Gap&quot; (1800‚Äì800 BC) was a period not accounted for by Schliemann's archaeology and thus constituted a hole in the Trojan timeline. In Homer's description of the city, a section of one side of the wall is said to be weaker than the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. &quot;Iliad&quot;. XVI,&lt;/ref&gt; During his excavation of more than three hundred yards of the wall, D√∂rpfeld came across a section very closely resembling the Homeric description of the weaker section.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; D√∂rpfeld was convinced he had found the walls of Homer's city, and now he would excavate the city itself. Within the walls of this stratum (Troy VI), much [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] pottery dating from [[Late Helladic]] (LH) periods III A and III B (c. 1400‚Äìc. 1200 BC) was uncovered, suggesting a relation between the Trojans and Mycenaeans. The great tower along the walls seemed likely to be the &quot;Great Tower of Ilios&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. &quot;Iliad&quot;. VI, 386&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence seemed to indicate that D√∂rpfeld had stumbled upon Ilios, the city of Homer's epics. Schliemann himself had conceded that Troy VI was more likely to be the Homeric city, but he never published anything stating so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1995|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The only counter-argument, confirmed initially by D√∂rpfeld (who was as passionate as Schliemann about finding Troy), was that the city appeared to have been destroyed by an earthquake, not by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little doubt that this was the Troy of which the Mycenaeans would have known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1985|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Troy VIII ===
In 480 BC, the Persian king [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] sacrificed 1,000 cattle at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias while marching through the Hellespontine region towards Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] 7.43.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Persian defeat in 480‚Äì479, Ilion and its territory became part of the continental possessions of [[Mytilene]] and remained under Mytilenaean control until the unsuccessful [[Mytilenean revolt]] in 428‚Äì427. Athens liberated the so-called Actaean cities including Ilion and enrolled these communities in the [[Delian League]]. Athenian influence in the Hellespont waned following the oligarchic coup of 411, and in that year the Spartan general Mindaros emulated Xerxes by likewise sacrificing to Athena Ilias.&lt;ref name=&quot;ilium&quot; group=note /&gt; From c. 410‚Äì399, Ilion was within the sphere of influence of the local dynasts at [[Lampsacus]] (Zenis, his wife Mania, and the usurper Meidias) who administered the region on behalf of the Persian satrap [[Pharnabazos II, Satrap of Phrygia|Pharnabazus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ilium&quot; group=note /&gt;

In 399, the Spartan general [[Dercylidas]] expelled the Greek garrison at Ilion who were controlling the city on behalf of the Lampsacene dynasts during a campaign which rolled back Persian influence throughout the Troad. Ilion remained outside the control of the Persian satrapal administration at [[Dascylium]] until the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387‚Äì386. In this period of renewed Persian control c. 387‚Äì367, a statue of [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]], the satrap of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], was erected in front of the temple of Athena Ilias.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 17.17.6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 360‚Äì359 the city was briefly controlled by [[Charidemus]] of [[Oreus]], a Euboean mercenary leader who occasionally worked for the Athenians.&lt;ref&gt;Demosthenes 23.154‚Äì157; Aeneas Tacticus 24.3‚Äì14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 359, he was expelled by the Athenian Menelaos son of Arrabaios, whom the Ilians honoured with a grant of [[proxeny]]‚Äîthis is recorded in the earliest civic decree to survive from Ilion.&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 334 [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Hellespont and came to the city, where he visited the temple of Athena Ilias, made sacrifices at the tombs of the Homeric heroes, and made the city free and exempt from taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis'' 1.11‚Äì12, Diodorus Siculus 17.17‚Äì18, Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander'' 15, Justin 9.5.12, Strabo 13.1.26, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the so-called 'Last Plans' of Alexander which became known after his death in June 323, he had planned to rebuild the temple of Athena Ilias on a scale that would have surpassed every other temple in the known world.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 18.4.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antigonus Monophthalmus]] took control of the Troad in 311 and created the new city of [[Alexandria Troas|Antigoneia Troas]] which was a [[synoikism]] of the cities of [[Skepsis]], [[Cebren|Kebren]], [[Neandreia]], [[Hamaxitus|Hamaxitos]], [[Larisa (Troad)|Larisa]], and [[Kolonai]]. In c. 311‚Äì306 the ''[[koinon]] ''of Athena Ilias was founded from the remaining cities in the Troad and along the Asian coast of the [[Dardanelles]] and soon after succeeded in securing a guarantee from Antigonus that he would respect their autonomy and freedom (he had not respected the autonomy of the cities which were synoikized to create Antigoneia).&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''koinon ''continued to function until at least the 1st century AD and primarily consisted of cities from the Troad, although for a time in the second half of the 3rd century it also included [[Myrlea]] and [[Chalcedon]] from the eastern [[Propontis]].&lt;ref&gt;Myrlea and Calchedon: Inschriften von Ilion 5‚Äì6.&lt;/ref&gt; The governing body of the ''koinon ''was the ''synedrion'' on which each city was represented by two delegates. The day-to-day running of the ''synedrion'', especially in relation to its finances, was left to a college of five ''agonothetai'', on which no city ever had more than one representative. This system of equal (rather than proportional) representation ensured that no one city could politically dominate the ''koinon''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Knoepfler, ‚ÄòLes agonoth√®tes de la Conf√©d√©ration d‚ÄôAth√©na Ilias: une interpretation nouvelle des donn√©es √©pigraphiques et ses cons√©quences pour la chronologie des √©missions mon√©taires du Koinon‚Äô ''Studi Ellenistici'' 24 (2010) 33‚Äì62.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of the ''koinon ''was to organize the annual Panathenaia festival which was held at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias. The festival brought huge numbers of pilgrims to Ilion for the duration of the festival as well as creating an enormous market (the ''panegyris'') which attracted traders from across the region.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyris'': L. Robert, Monnaies antiques en Troade (Paris 1966) 18‚Äì46.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''koinon ''financed new building projects at Ilion, for example a new theatre c. 306 and the expansion of the sanctuary and temple of Athena Ilias in the 3rd century, in order to make the city a suitable venue for such a large festival.&lt;ref&gt;Theatre: Inschriften von Ilion 1. Temple: C. B. Rose, ‚ÄòThe Temple of Athena at Ilion‚Äô ''Studia Troica'' 13 (2003) 27‚Äì88 and contra D. Hertel, ‚ÄòZum Heiligtum der Athena Ilias von Troia IX und zur fr√ºhhellenistischen Stadtanlage von Ilion‚Äô ''ArchAnz ''(2004) 177‚Äì205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period 302‚Äì281, Ilion and the Troad were part of the kingdom of [[Lysimachus]], who during this time helped Ilion synoikize several nearby communities, thus expanding the city's population and territory.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Strabo 13.1.26: [ŒõœÖœÉŒØŒºŒ±œáŒøœÇ] œÉœÖŒΩ·ø¥Œ∫ŒπœÉŒ≠ œÑŒµ Œµ·º∞œÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÑ·Ω∞œÇ Œ∫œçŒ∫Œª·ø≥ œÄœåŒªŒµŒπœÇ ·ºÄœÅœáŒ±ŒØŒ±œÇ ·º§Œ¥Œ∑ Œ∫ŒµŒ∫Œ±Œ∫œâŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ±œÇ. These probably included [[Birytis]], [[Gentinos]], and Sigeion: J. M. Cook, ''The Troad ''(Oxford 1973) 364. Birytis and Gentinos are not securely located, but recent excavations at Sigeion appear to independently confirm Strabo‚Äôs account by indicating an abandonment date soon after c. 300: Th. Sch√§fer, ''Kazƒ± Sonu√ßlarƒ± Toplantƒ±sƒ±'' 32.2 (2009) 410‚Äì412, 33.2 (2012) 248‚Äì249. This may have been punishment for Sigeion resisting Lysimachus in 302: Diodorus 20.107.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Lysimachus was defeated at the [[Battle of Corupedium]] in February 281 by [[Seleucus I Nikator]], thus handing the Seleucid kingdom control of [[Asia Minor]], and in August or September 281 when Seleucus passed through the Troad on his way to [[Lysimachia (Thrace)|Lysimachia]] in the nearby Thracian Chersonese Ilion passed a decree in honour of him, indicating the city's new loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In September Seleucus was assassinated at Lysimachia by [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], making his successor, [[Antiochus I Soter]], the new king. In 280 or soon after Ilion passed a long decree lavishly honouring Antiochus in order to cement their relationship with him.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 32. A minority of scholars instead attempt to date this inscription to the reign of Antiochus III (222‚Äì187 BC).&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Ilion still lacked proper city walls except for the crumbling Troy VI fortifications around the citadel, and in 278 during the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invasion]] the city was easily sacked.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 13.1.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Ilion enjoyed a close relationship with Antiochus for the rest of his reign: for example, in 274 Antiochus granted land to his friend Aristodikides of Assos which for tax purposes was to be attached to the territory of Ilion, and c. 275‚Äì269 Ilion passed a decree in honour of Metrodoros of Amphipolis who had successfully treated the king for a wound he received in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Inschriften von Ilion 33 (Aristodikides), 34 (Metrodoros).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Troy IX ===
[[File:Tetradrachm from Troy.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] from Troy with head of [[Athena]], c. 165‚Äì150&amp;nbsp;BC]]
[[File:Hadrianic Odeon in Troy IX (Ilion).Turkey (3).jpg|thumb|The [[Odeon (building)|odeon]] dates to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Troy IX and was renovated by [[Hadrian]] in 124 AD.]]
The city was destroyed by [[Sulla]]'s rival, the Roman general [[Gaius Flavius Fimbria|Fimbria]], in 85 BC following an eleven-day siege.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 13.1.27, Livy, ''Periochae'' 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year when Sulla had defeated Fimbria he bestowed benefactions on Ilion for its loyalty which helped with the city's rebuilding. Ilion reciprocated this act of generosity by instituting a new civic calendar which took 85 BC as its first year.&lt;ref&gt;''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.2‚Äì3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city remained in financial distress for several decades, despite its favoured status with Rome. In the 80s BC, Roman ''publicani'' illegally levied taxes on the sacred estates of Athena Ilias and the city was required to call on [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|L. Julius Caesar]] for restitution; while in 80 BC, the city suffered an attack by pirates.&lt;ref&gt;''Inchriften von Ilion'' 71 (''publicani''), 73 (pirates).&lt;/ref&gt; In 77 BC the costs of running the annual festival of the ''koinon'' of Athena Ilias became too pressing for both Ilion and the other members of the ''koinon'' and L. Julius Caesar was once again required to arbitrate, this time reforming the festival so that it would be less of a financial burden.&lt;ref&gt;''Inschriften von Ilion'' 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 74 BC the Ilians once again demonstrated their loyalty to Rome by siding with the Roman general [[Lucullus]] against Mithridates VI.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lucullus'' 10.3, 12.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the final defeat of Mithridates in 63‚Äì62, [[Pompey]] rewarded the city's loyalty by becoming the benefactor of Ilion and patron of Athena Ilias.&lt;ref&gt;''Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum'' 46.1565.&lt;/ref&gt; In 48 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] likewise bestowed benefactions on the city, recalling the city's loyalty during the Mithridatic Wars, the city's connection with his cousin L. Julius Caesar, and the family's claim that they were ultimately descended from Venus through the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] and therefore shared kinship with the Ilians.&lt;ref&gt;Lucan, ''Pharsalia'' 9.964‚Äì999, Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' 79.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20 BC, the Emperor [[Augustus]] visited Ilion and stayed in the house of a leading citizen, Melanippides son of Euthydikos.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 54.7, ''Inschriften von Ilion'' 83.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his visit, he also financed the restoration and rebuilding of the sanctuary of Athena Ilias, the [[bouleuterion]] (council house) and the theatre. Soon after work on the theatre was completed in 12‚Äì11 BC, Melanippides dedicated a statue Augustus in the theatre to record this benefaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Inschriften von Ilion'' 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Priam's Treasure ==
[[File:Priam's treasure.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Priam's Treasure]], which [[Heinrich Schliemann]] claimed to have found at Troy]]
Some of the most notable artifacts uncovered at Hisarlik are known as [[Priam's Treasure]]. Most of these pieces were crafted from gold and other precious metals. Heinrich Schliemann put this assemblage together from his first excavation site, which he thought to be the remains of Homeric Troy. He gave them this name after King Priam, who is said ln the ancient literature to have ruled during the Trojan War. However, the site that housed the treasure was later identified as Troy II, whereas Priam's Troy would most likely have been Troy VII. One of the most famous photographs of Sophia made not long after the discovery depicts her wearing a golden headdress, which is known as the &quot;Jewels of Helen&quot; (see under Schliemann above).

Other pieces that are a part of this collection are:

* copper artifacts - a shield, cauldron, axeheads, lance heads, daggers, etc.
* silver artifacts - vases, goblets, knife blades, etc.
* gold artifacts - bottle, cups, rings, buttons, bracelets, etc.
* terra cotta goblets
* artifacts with a combination of precious metals

More information on these treasures can be found on the [[Priam's Treasure]] site.

== Troy in Late Bronze Age Hittite and Egyptian records==
In the 1920s, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] scholar [[Emil Forrer]] proposed that the placenames Wilusa and Taruisa found in [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts should be identified with Ilion and Troia, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|Morris|1995|pp=34‚Äì35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted that the name of [[Alaksandu]], a king of Wilusa mentioned in a Hittite treaty, is quite similar to Homer's [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], whose birthname was Alexandros. Subsequent to this, the [[Tawagalawa letter]] ([[Catalogue des Textes Hittites|CTH]] 181) was found to document an unnamed Hittite king's correspondence to the king of the [[Ahhiyawa]], referring to an earlier &quot;Wilusa episode&quot; involving hostility on the part of the Ahhiyawa. The Hittite king was long held to be [[Mursili II]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1321‚Äì1296), but, since the 1980s, his son [[Hattusili III]] (1265‚Äì1240) is commonly preferred, although his other son [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1296‚Äì1272) remains a possibility.

Inscriptions of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] also record a nation T-R-S as one of the [[Sea Peoples]] who attacked [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|XX Dynasties]]. An inscription at [[Deir el-Medina]] records a victory of [[Ramesses III]] over the Sea Peoples, including one named &quot;Tursha&quot; (Egyptian: [''twr≈°3'']). It is probably the same as the earlier &quot;Teresh&quot; (Egyptian: [''tr≈°.w'']) on the [[Merneptah Stele|stele]] commemorating [[Merneptah]]'s victory in a [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] campaign around 1220&amp;nbsp;BC.

These identifications were rejected by many scholars as being improbable or at least unprovable. However, [[Trevor Bryce]] championed them in his 1998 book ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'', citing a piece of the [[Manapa-Tarhunda letter]] referring to the kingdom of Wilusa as beyond the land of the Seha River (the classical [[Caicus]] and modern [[Bakƒ±r√ßay]]) and near the land of &quot;Lazpa&quot; ([[Lesbos]]). Recent evidence also adds weight to the theory that Wilusa is identical to archaeological Troy. Hittite texts mention a [[water tunnel (physical infrastructure)|water tunnel]] at Wilusa, and a water tunnel excavated by Korfmann, previously thought to be Roman, has been dated to around 2600&amp;nbsp;BC. The identifications of Wilusa with Troy and of the Ahhiyawa with Homer's [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] remain somewhat controversial but gained enough popularity during the 1990s to be considered majority opinion. That agrees with [[Metrical foot|metrical]] evidence in the [[Iliad]] that the name ·æΩŒôŒªŒπŒøŒΩ (Ilion) for Troy was formerly œúŒπŒªŒπŒøŒΩ (Wilion) with a [[digamma]].&lt;ref name=met group=note&gt;&quot;Metrical evidence&quot; is a specialized term from the study of Greek poetry. Where English poetry constructs its metric feet from emphasized and unemphasized syllables:&quot;Listen my children and you shall hear ...,&quot; ancient Greek uses long and short syllables, the length being determined according to the sequence of long and short vowels and clusters of consonants. Homer wrote his poetry in dactylic hexameter: &quot;Menin aeide thea ....&quot; From the fact that some syllables are treated as long when they should be short leads the linguists to conclude that an initial &quot;w&quot; was dropped at some time after composition: Ilion for former Wilion.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical and post-classical Ilium (Ilion) ==
{{no footnotes|section|date=November 2019}}
A new city called '''Ilium''' (from Greek Ilion) was founded on the site in the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It flourished until the establishment of [[Constantinople]], became a bishopric in the [[Roman province]] [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontus]] (civil [[Diocese of Asia]]), but declined gradually in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]]

=== Ecclesiastical history ===
No later than the 4th century, it was a [[suffragan]] of the provincial capital's Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Cyzicus]], in the sway of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].
Several bishops are historically documented:
* Orion attended the [[First Ecumenical Council]] at [[Nicaea]] in 325
* Leucadius was among the schismatic group of [[Arian]] heretical bishops abandoning the [[Council of Sardica]] and [[Council of Philippopolis]] in 344 to convene their alternative 'synod'.
* Theosebius partook in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.
* Johannes participated in the second [[Second Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] in 553.
* Nicetas attended the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.
* Georgius participated in the [[Council of Constantinople (869-870)|Council of Constantinople]] of 869‚Äì870 which condemned Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios of Constantinople]].

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored no later than 1926 as Latin [[Titular bishopric]] of Ilium (Latin) / Ilio (Curiate Italian) / Ilien(sis) (Latin adjective).

It has been vacant for decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank:
* [[Michel d'Herbigny]] [[Jesuit Order|S.J.]] (1926.02.11 ‚Äì 1937.07)
* James Maguire (1939.10.05 ‚Äì 1944.10.10)
* Eugene Joseph McGuinness (1944.11.11 ‚Äì 1948.02.01)
* Leo John Steck (1948.03.13 ‚Äì 1950.06.19)
* Francesco Maria Franco (1950.07.10 ‚Äì 1968.02.07)

A small minority of contemporary writers argue that Homeric Troy was not at the Hisarlik site, but elsewhere in Anatolia or outside it‚Äîe.g. in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Iman Jacobs | last=Wilkens | title=Where Troy Once Stood: The Mystery of Homer's ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' revealed | location=[[Groningen]] | publisher= Rider &amp; Co | year=1990 | page=68 | isbn=978-0-7126-2463-3| title-link=Where Troy Once Stood }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pergamum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lascelles|first1=John|title=Troy: The World Deceived.

=== Mediaeval legends ===
Such was the fame of the [[Epic Cycle]] in Roman and Medieval times that it was built upon to provide a starting point for various [[founding myth]]s of national origins. The most influential, [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', traces the journeys of the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]], supposed ancestor of the [[Romulus and Remus|founders of Rome]] and the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. In a later era, the heroes of Troy, both those noted in Homer and those invented for the purpose, often continued to appear in the origin stories of the nations of Early Medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=huppert&gt;{{cite journal | last=Huppert | first=George | title=The Trojan Franks and their Critics | journal=Studies in the Renaissance | volume=12 | year=1965 | pages=227‚Äì41 | doi=10.2307/2857076| jstor=2857076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hay | first=Denys | title=Europe: The Emergence of an Idea | year=1968 | location=Edinburgh | publisher=Edinburgh U.P. | pages=49‚Äì50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Roman de Troie]]'' was common cultural ground for European dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;A. Joly first traced the career of the ''Roman de Troie'' in ''Benoit de Sainte-More et le Roman de Troie'' (Paris 1871).&lt;/ref&gt; as a Trojan pedigree was both gloriously ancient and established an equality with the ruling class of Rome. A Trojan pedigree could justify the occupation of parts of Rome's former territories.&lt;ref name=huppert/&gt;

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] writes that the Trojans were Greek people who were originally from the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;[ Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.60.3-1.61.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

On that basis, the Franks filled the lacunae of their legendary origins with Trojan and pseudo-Trojan names: in [[Fredegar]]'s 7th-century chronicle of Frankish history, Priam appears as the first king of the Franks.&lt;ref&gt;''Exinde origo Francorum fuit. Priamo primo rege habuerant.''&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Trojan origin of France was such an established article of faith that in 1714, the learned [[Nicolas Fr√©ret]] was [[Bastille]]d for showing through historical criticism that the Franks had been Germanic, a sore point counter to [[Valois dynasty|Valois]] and [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]] propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;''Larousse du XIXe si√®cle'' sub &quot;Fr√©ret&quot;, noted by Huppert 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In similar manner, [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] reworked earlier material such as the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' to trace the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|legendary kings of the Britons]] from a supposed descendant of [[Aeneas]] called [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]].

Likewise, [[Snorri Sturluson]], in the prologue to his Icelandic ''[[Prose Edda]]'', traced the genealogy of the ancestral figures in [[Norse mythology]] to characters appearing at Troy in Homer's epic, notably making [[Thor]] to be the son of [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]]. Sturluson referred to these figures as having made a journey across Europe towards [[Scandinavia]], setting up kingdoms as they went.
