'''Turku''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʊər|k|uː}} {{respell|TOOR|koo}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/Turku &quot;Turku&quot;] (US) and {{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Turku|accessdate=April 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Turku|accessdate=April 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fi|ˈturku|lang|Fi-Turku.ogg}}; {{lang-sv|Åbo}} {{IPA-sv|ˈoːbʊ||sv-Åbo.ogg}}, {{IPA-sv|ˈoːbu|langfi|Åbo.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Finland|city]] on the southwest coast of [[Finland]] at the mouth of the [[Aura (Archipelago Sea)|Aura River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;turku_stats&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Aluetietopankki' at the Kuntaliitto website&lt;/ref&gt; in the region of [[Southwest Finland|Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi)]]. The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country. 

Turku, as a town, was never founded. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.

As the oldest town in the country Turku was the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule the Kingdom of Sweden. After the war Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the [[Russian Empire]] (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous  [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was moved to [[Helsinki]] (1812).

It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.

Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.

Because of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced [[History of Finland|Finnish history]]. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.

Along with [[Tallinn]], the capital city of [[Estonia]], Turku was designated the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=9289&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |title=Christmas City » Turku, the Finnish Christmas City |publisher=www.turku.fi |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095158/https://www.turku.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=9289&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger [[seaport]] with over three million passengers traveling through the [[Port of Turku]] each year to [[Stockholm]] and [[Mariehamn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;turku_stats&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Statistical yearbook of Turku | url = http://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=3981&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 | date = 2008-07-17 | language = Finnish | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175319/https://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=3981&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 | archivedate = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vamuu/statfin_vamuu_pxt_001.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=be87bf03-2bee-49e1-8a2f-ad390937d954|title=Preliminary population 2018|date=5 November 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029190516/http://vrk.fi/default.aspx?docid=8639&amp;site=3&amp;id=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of Finnish municipalities by population|sixth largest]] city in Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;population_count&quot;/&gt; There were 330,192&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vamuu/statfin_vamuu_pxt_001.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=be87bf03-2bee-49e1-8a2f-ad390937d954|title=Turku sub-regional unit, Preliminary population by Month|date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants living in the [[Turku sub-region]], ranking it as the [[List of urban areas in Finland by population|third largest]] urban area in Finland after the [[Greater Helsinki]] area and [[Tampere]] sub-region. The city is officially [[bilingual]] as {{Formatnum: {{#expr: (({{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language Swedish|Turku}}/{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language total|Turku}}) * 100) round 1}}}} percent of its population identify Swedish as a [[mother-tongue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;population_by_language&quot;/&gt;

=={{anchor|Names and etymology}}Names and etymology==
{{see also|Names of Turku in different languages}}
The Finnish name ''Turku'' originates from an [[Old East Slavic]] word, ''[[wikt:търгъ#Old East Slavic|tǔrgǔ]]'', meaning &quot;[[market place]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katajala.net/keskiaika/suomi/kaupungit.html |title=Keskiaika - Suomen kaupungit keskiajalla |publisher=Katajala.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[wikt:turku#Finnish|turku]]'' still means &quot;market place&quot; in some Finnish dialects. 

The Swedish name ''Åbo'' may be a simple combination of ''å'' (&quot;river; creek; large stream&quot;) and ''bo'' (&quot;dwelling&quot;). As this pattern does not appear in any other Swedish place names in Finland, etymologists believe there could be a different explanation. One theory is that it comes from &quot;Aabo&quot;, the Finnish rendition of the Russian &quot;Avram&quot; ([[Abraham]]), which could also be the origin of the name of the river [[Aura (Archipelago Sea)|Aura]].&lt;ref&gt;[[YLE]], ''1000 km ortnamn'', 2003, http://vetamix.net/video/ortnamnet-%C3%A5bo_2273. Retrieved 2015-&lt;/ref&gt; There is however an old legal term called &quot;{{illm|åborätt|sv|åborätt}}&quot; (meaning roughly &quot;right to live at&quot;), which gave citizens (called &quot;åbo&quot;) the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (''å'' meant ''at'' or ''on'' in old Swedish, now ''på'').&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Åborätt]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the [[Finnish noun cases|genitive]] of ''Turku'' is '''''Turun''''', meaning &quot;of Turku&quot;. The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in ''Turun yliopisto'' for the [[University of Turku]].

==History==
Turku has a long history as [[Finland]]'s largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by [[Helsinki]]. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfinland.com/W5/index.nsf/(pages)/Destinations |title=Destinations in Finland - Official Travel and Tourism Guide |publisher=Visitfinland.com |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country's first capital. Originally, the word &quot;Finland&quot; referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, &quot;[[Finland Proper]]&quot; for the region).

[[File:Cathedral of Turku 1814.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Turku Cathedral]], 1814, prior to the [[Great Fire of Turku|Great Fire]] in 1827]]

Although archaeological findings in the area date back to the [[Stone Age]] and early literary sources such as [[Al-Idrisi]]'s world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.utu.fi/media/ajankohtaista/argumentit/AkiPihlman.html|title= Varhainen Turku rakennettiin pellolle|accessdate= 2008-05-06|author= Aki Pihlman|date= 2006-09-13|language= Finnish|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090113003534/https://www.utu.fi/media/ajankohtaista/argumentit/AkiPihlman.html|archivedate= 2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turku Cathedral]] was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1300.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spicer2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Spicer|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyErqszUsFYC&amp;pg=PA314|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6583-0|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Turku was the seat of the [[Bishop of Turku]] (a title later upgraded to [[Archdiocese of Turku|Archbishop of Turku]]), covering the then eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of [[Duke of Finland|Dukes]] and [[Governor-General in the Swedish Realm|Governors-General of Finland]] usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the [[War against Sigismund]], the town was the site of the [[Åbo Bloodbath]]. In 1640, the first [[university]] in Finland, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the [[States of Finland]] in 1676.

[[File:Turku 1842 - Henrik Cajander.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[daguerreotype]] photograph of the Nobel House, the first photograph taken in Finland, from 1842]]

After the [[Finnish War]], which ended when [[Sweden]] ceded Finland to [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] at the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as [[Emperor]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the [[Great Fire of Turku]], which almost completely destroyed the city in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitturku.fi/en/where-did-great-fire-of-turku-begin_en|title=Where did the Great Fire of Turku begin?|last=route66|date=2016-11-11|website=Visit Turku|language=fi|access-date=2019-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by [[Germany|German]] [[architect]] [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.

[[File:Aurakatu 1910's.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Aurakatu area in the 1910s]]

In 1918, a new university, the [[Åbo Akademi]] – the only [[Swedish language]] university in Finland – was founded in Turku. Two years later, the [[Finnish language]] [[University of Turku]] was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.

In the 20th century, Turku was called &quot;Finland's gateway to the West&quot; by historians such as [[Jarmo Virmavirta]]. The city enjoyed good connections with other [[Western Europe]]an countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with [[Stockholm]] across the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a [[town twinning|twinning]] agreement with [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] in the [[Soviet Union]], leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of [[Communism]] in [[Russia]], many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them [[Vladimir Putin]], then Leningrad's deputy [[mayor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triposo.com/loc/Turku/history/background|title=Turku History|website=www.triposo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945 {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the [[Market Square, Turku|Market Square]] was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.

==Geography==
{{More citations needed|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Aura River Turku.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Aura River (Finland)|Aura River]] seen further away from central Turku]]
Located at the mouth of the [[Aura River (Finland)|Aura river]] in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of {{convert|245|km2}} of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as ''täl pual jokke'' (&quot;this side of the river&quot;), while the western side is referred to as ''tois pual jokke'' (&quot;the other side of the river&quot;). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is ''Auransilta'', which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is ''Kirjastosilta'' ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&amp;nodeid=23 |title=Kirjastosilta avattiin tulen ja valon juhlassa |publisher=www.turku.fi |accessdate=2014-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114100705/https://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&amp;nodeid=23 |archivedate=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Föri]]'', a small [[ferry]] that transports pedestrians and [[bicycle]]s across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.

With a population of approximately 300,000{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}, the [[Turku sub-region|Turku Region]] ([[Local administrative unit|LAU]]&amp;nbsp;1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after [[Greater Helsinki]] and the area around [[Tampere]]. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: [[Askainen]], [[Kaarina]], [[Lemu]], [[Lieto]], [[Masku]], [[Merimasku]], [[Mynämäki]], [[Naantali]], [[Nousiainen]], [[Paimio]], [[Piikkiö]], [[Raisio]], [[Rusko]], [[Rymättylä]], [[Sauvo]], [[Vahto]], and [[Velkua]].

A more exclusive definition for the urban area is the [[Turku sub-region|city region of Turku]] with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.

===Administrative subdivisions===
{{Main|Wards of Turku}}
[[File:Stålarminkatu-Mestarinkatu.jpg|thumb|right|[[IV District, Turku|IV District]], or Martti, is one of the smallest but most densely populated districts of Turku.]]
The city is divided into 78 districts and nine [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are [[Varissuo]] and [[Runosmäki]]. By area, however, [[Kakskerta]] and [[Paattinen]], formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

As many of the small neighbouring [[municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated [[pear]]. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku [[Bypass (road)|bypass]], that forms part of [[European route E18]]. Islands such as [[Ruissalo]], [[Hirvensalo]] and [[Kakskerta]], forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into [[upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[suburb]]s.

===Climate===
[[File:Autumn in Turku.jpg|thumb|Area of [[Turku cathedral]] in autumn.]]
Situated by the [[Baltic Sea]] and sheltered by the islands of the [[Archipelago Sea]], Turku has a [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with [[temperature]]s ranging up to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F), and relatively cold winters with frequent [[snow]]fall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of {{convert|17.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is {{convert|5.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] in Turku averages {{convert|720|mm|1|abbr=on}} a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average {{convert|80|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only {{convert|32|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The average [[air pressure]] at sea level is {{convert|101.2|kPa|inHg}}, with little variance throughout the year.

Operational since 1955, the city's [[weather station]] is located at an altitude of {{convert|47|m|ft|abbr=off}} at [[Turku Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;'Turku' at EuroWeather&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Turku Vappu 2008.jpg|thumb|People celebrating [[Vappu]] in central Turku]]

==Economy==
[[File:Oasis of the Seas 2009-10-18.jpg|thumb|right|[[MS Oasis of the Seas]], formerly the world's largest passenger ship, was built in Turku.]]

The business district in the city's economy is centred on the [[Port of Turku]] and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned [[high tech]] centre – the [[Turku Science Park]] area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} from the fields of [[biotechnology]] and [[information technology]], as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the ''Turku Strategy'' that is published annually by the city council. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
At least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: [[HKScan]] and [[Hesburger]]. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include [[Bayer]], [[Fläkt Woods]], [[Meyer Werft]], [[Orion Corporation]] and [[Wärtsilä]].

{{As of|2015|June}}, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June’s numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men’s unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women’s 9.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unemployment rate at 10%, every fifth young person without work|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/unemployment_rate_at_10_every_fifth_young_person_without_work/8171703|website=YLE|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{More citations needed|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Turun tuomiokirkko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Turku Cathedral]], one of the most notable historical buildings in Finland.]]
[[Culture of Finland|Cultural venues]] in Turku include several [[theatre]]s, [[movie theater|cinemas]], and [[art gallery|art galleries]], and a city philharmonic [[orchestra]]. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the [[Medieval Market of Turku|Medieval Market]] in July each year. Turku is also the official [[Christmas]] city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The [[Turku music festival]] and the [[rock festival]] [[Ruisrock]] (held on the island of [[Ruissalo]]) are among the oldest of its kind in [[Scandinavia]]. The city also hosts another rock festival, [[Down by the Laituri]], and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org/ |title=www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org |publisher=www.uudenmusiikinfestivaali.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, &quot;New Music Festival&quot;), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.

There are also numerous [[museum]]s, such as the Turku Art Museum and the [[Wäinö Aaltonen Museum of Art]]. The Åbo Akademi University maintains the [[Sibelius Museum]], which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the [[Turku Castle]], which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the ''[[Aboa Vetus]]'' museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century [[Archaeology|archaeological]] site. The ''[[Luostarinmäki]]'' [[handicraft]]s museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, was the first [[Scandinavia]]n venue to receive the &quot;Golden Apple&quot; tourism award.

Turku is [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.

The [[Declaration of Christmas Peace]] has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the [[Winter War]]. The declaration takes place on the [[Old Great Square (Turku)|Old Great Square of Turku]], Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn ''Jumala ompi linnamme'' ([[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]'') and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a [[parchment]] roll in Finnish and Swedish.

==Sports==
[[File:Paavo Nurmi Marathon, 2007, Aurakatu.jpg|thumb|[[Paavo Nurmi Marathon (Turku)|Paavo Nurmi Marathon]] is run every summer.]]

The city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the ''[[Veikkausliiga]]'': [[FC Inter Turku|FC Inter]] and [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]]. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at [[Veritas Stadion]] in the district of [[Kupittaa]].

[[HC TPS]] of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, [[SM-liiga]]. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009-2010. [[Gatorade Center]], formerly named ''HK Arena'', located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.

The ''[[Paavo Nurmi Marathon (Turku)|Paavo Nurmi Marathon]]'' is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner [[Paavo Nurmi]], who was born and raised in the city.

Finland's most successful [[tennis]] player, [[Jarkko Nieminen]], was born and lives in the neighbouring county of [[Masku]]

Turku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turkutitans.fi/club.htm |title=Turku Titans history |publisher=Turku Titans |accessdate=2010-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194200/https://www.turkutitans.fi/club.htm |archivedate=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2012worldlacrosse.com/ |title= 2012 World Lacrosse |publisher=FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
[[File:Turun hovioikeus.jpg|thumb|The Court of Appeal and Academy House of Turku]]
[[File:Turun kaupungintalo.jpg|thumb|[[Turku City Hall]], on the west side of the Aura River]]
Being both a [[regions of Finland|regional]] and [[provinces of Finland|provincial]] capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the [[Archdiocese of Turku|Archbishop of Finland]] and a [[Appellate court|Court of Appeal]]. [[Aleksi Randell]] has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.

The [[city council]] of Turku has 67 seats. Following the [[2017 Finnish municipal elections|2017 municipal election]], the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/KV-2017/fi/kutulos_853.html |title=Turku: Tulos puolueittain ja yhteislistoittain |publisher=Ministry of Justice |date= 13 April 2017 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chair of the city board is [[Minna Arve]] from National Coalition Party.

For a city of its size, Turku has a moderate [[public transport]] network of [[bus]] routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized [[Tampere]]. The bus network is managed and supervised by the ''Turku City Region’s Public Transport Committee'' (FÖLI) ({{lang-fi|Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta}}, {{lang-sv|kollektivtrafiknämnden för Åbo stadsregion}}), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by FÖLI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa |title=Joukkoliikennetietoa |accessdate=2016-01-14 |publisher=Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta |language=Finnish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110115933/http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa |archivedate=2016-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, [[VR (Finnish railway company)|VR]]. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the [[Turku Central railway station]] in [[Pohjola, Turku|Pohjola]], and two smaller stations in [[Kupittaa]] and the [[Port of Turku]].

There is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular [[tram]] services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, there are plans for a [[light rail]] system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosmäki, as well as the neighbouring cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raitio.org/historia/pika/pika.htm |title=Raitiovaunulla Naantaliin, Kaarinaan, Runosmäkeen, Varissuolle? |accessdate=2008-07-11 |last=Laaksonen |first=Mikko |work=raitio.org |publisher=Finnish Tramways Society |language=Finnish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901225302/http://www.raitio.org/historia/pika/pika.htm |archivedate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Finland has announced plans to support [[Espoo]] with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070630122159/http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-06-30 |title=Turun Sanomat |publisher=Turunsanomat.fi |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2009-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long distance buses.

[[Turku Airport]] is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of [[Rusko]]. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including [[airBaltic]] and [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS Scandinavian]], and one cargo airline.

There are also daily ferry services from the [[Port of Turku]] to Sweden and the [[Åland Islands]], operated by [[Silja Line]] and [[Viking Line]]. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see [[ruotsinlaiva]]), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a [[cruising (maritime)|cruise]] across the Gulf of Bothnia.

The [[Archipelago Sea]] boat traffic is handled by, among others, [[SS Ukkopekka]], an old [[steamship]] that cruises on the route Turku-[[Naantali]]-Turku.

Turku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: [[Turku Central Station|Turku Central]], [[Port of Turku]], and [[Kupittaa railway station|Kupittaa]].

==Education==
[[File:Turun yliopisto.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the [[University of Turku]]]]

Turku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city – the first school in the city, the [[Katedralskolan i Åbo|Cathedral School]], was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first [[university]] in Finland, the &quot;[[Royal Academy of Turku]]&quot; (now [[University of Helsinki]]), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the [[Bell-Lancaster method]] was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.

Turku is home to about 35,000 higher education students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=4904&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |title=www.turku.fi » turku.fi » Turku.info » Turku in Brief |publisher=turku.fi |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095212/https://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=4904&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two universities and several &quot;[[University of applied sciences (Finland)|polytechnics]]&quot; in the town.

The Finnish [[University of Turku]] is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. [[Åbo Akademi]], founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university.  [[Turku School of Economics]] merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and Åbo handelshögskola, its Swedish counterpart, with Åbo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, [[Turku University Hospital]], is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.

[[Turku University of Applied Sciences]] is the second largest [[Institute of technology#Finland|polytechnic]] in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also [[Novia University of Applied Sciences]] and [[Diaconia University of Applied Sciences]] have campuses in the town.

Turku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established [[international school]] (the other city being Helsinki). [[Turku International School]], located in the eastern district of [[Varissuo]], has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the [[University of Turku]], [[Turun normaalikoulu]] takes care of the teaching in the international school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tnk.utu.fi/index.php?id=1389&amp;news_id=125&amp;archive=|title= Turku International School|publisher= [[University of Turku]]|date= 15 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
[[File:Turun kaupunginkirjaston päärakennus.jpg|thumb|Main library of Turku]]
The most widely read [[list of Finnish newspapers|newspaper]] of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper ''[[Turun Sanomat]]'', with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. ''[[Åbo Underrättelser]]'', a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge ''Turkulainen'' newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of ''[[Metro International]]'' and the national evening [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Tutkimus: Lehtien lukijapeitot''&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of local newspapers such as ''Kulmakunta'' (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and ''Rannikkoseutu'' (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).

The first Finnish newspaper ''[[Tidningar Utgifne Af et Sällskap i Åbo]]'', in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771,&lt;ref&gt;Finnish Wikipedia article [[:fi:Tidningar Utgifne Af et Sällskap i Åbo]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper ''Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat'' which was started in 1775.

The newspaper ''Turun Sanomat'' also operates a regional [[television]] station, called ''Turku TV''. The Finnish national broadcaster ''[[Yleisradio]]'' screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of [[Southwest Finland]] and [[Satakunta]]) residents. All [[list of Finnish television channels|Finnish national TV channels]] are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local [[radio]] stations, e.g. ''Auran Aallot'', ''Radio Sata'' and ''Radio Robin Hood'' are operational. Local [[public broadcasting|public service]] radio stations are ''Yle Turun Radio'' in Finnish language (the regional version of [[Yle Radio Suomi]]) and ''Yle Vega Åboland'' in Swedish language (the regional version of [[Yle Vega]]).
