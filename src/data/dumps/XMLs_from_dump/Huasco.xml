'''Huasco''' ({{IPA-es|ˈwasko}}) is a [[Chile]]an [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]], in the [[Huasco Province]], [[Atacama Region]].

The port city of Huasco is located 50&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Vallenar]] and close to the town of ''Huasco Bajo'', which lies on the southern bank of the [[Huasco River]] and only a few km from its mouth. The coastal route between Huasco Bajo and [[Carrizal Bajo]] provides one of the two accesses to [[Llanos de Challe National Park]]. The port was used between 1851 and 1873 to ship copper ore, copper regulus, alpaca wool and hides round Cape Horn to [[Swansea]], [[Glamorgan]] and [[Wales]].

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 [[census]] of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], Huasco had 7,945 inhabitants (3,999 men and 3,946 women). Of these, 6,445 (81.1%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 1,500 (18.9%) in [[rural area]]s. The population grew by 5.7% (429 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.&lt;ref name= &quot;INE&quot;/&gt;

==Administration==
As a commune, Huasco is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an [[alcalde]] who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Rodrigo Loyola Morenilla.

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Huasco is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Mr. Alberto Robles ([[Social Democrat Radical Party|PRSD]]) and Mr. Giovanni Calderón  ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]) as part of the 6th electoral district, (together with [[Caldera, Chile|Caldera]], [[Tierra Amarilla, Chile|Tierra Amarilla]], [[Vallenar]], [[Freirina]] and [[Alto del Carmen]]).
