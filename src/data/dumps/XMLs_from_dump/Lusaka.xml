'''Lusaka''' ({{IPAc-en|l|uː|ˈ|s|ɑː|k|ə}} {{respell|loo|SAH|kə}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Zambia]]. One of the fastest developing cities in southern Africa, Lusaka is in the southern part of the central plateau at an elevation of about {{convert|1279|m|ft}}. {{As of|2010}}, the city's population was about 1.7 million, while the urban population is 2.4 million. Lusaka is the centre of both commerce and government in Zambia and connects to the country's four main highways heading [[Great North Road, Zambia|north]], [[Livingstone Road|south]], [[Great East Road|east]] and [[Great West Road, Zambia|west]]. English is the official language of the city administration, while [[Chewa language|Chewa]] and [[Bemba language|Bemba]] are the commonly spoken street languages.

== History==
{{see also|Timeline of Lusaka}}
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-3-235.jpg|thumb|left|Government House, built for the [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia]]]]
Lusaka was the site of a village named after its Chief Lusaka, which, according to history, was located at Manda Hill, near where the Zambia's National Assembly building now stands. In the [[Chichewa|Nyanja]] language, ''Manda'' means graveyard. The area was expanded by European (mainly British) settlers in 1905 with the building of the railway. &lt;ref&gt; Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DFVS4IixY5oC&amp;pg=PA158|title=Zambia: Life in an African Country|last=Mwakikagile|first=Godfrey|date=2010|publisher=New Africa Press|isbn=9789987160112|pages=158|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502234040/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DFVS4IixY5oC&amp;pg=PA158|archivedate=2 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, due to its fairly central location, its situation on the railway and at the crossroads of the [[Great North Road, Zambia|Great North Road]] and [[Great East Road]], it was chosen to replace [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] as the capital of the British colony of [[Northern Rhodesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DFVS4IixY5oC&amp;pg=PA159|title=Zambia: Life in an African Country|last=Mwakikagile|first=Godfrey|date=2010|publisher=New Africa Press|isbn=9789987160112|pages=159|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502234040/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DFVS4IixY5oC&amp;pg=PA159|archivedate=2 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Lusaka  Lusaka], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

After the federation of Northern and [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1953, it was a centre of the independence movement amongst some of the educated elite that led to the creation of the Republic of Zambia. In 1964, Lusaka became the capital of the newly independent Zambia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In recent years, Lusaka has become a popular urban settlement for Zambians and tourists alike. Its central nature and fast growing infrastructure sector have increased donor confidence and as such Zambians are seeing signs of development in the form of job creation, housing, etc. Consequently, it is thought that with proper and effective economic reforms, Lusaka as well as Zambia as a whole will develop considerably. Lusaka is home to a diverse community of foreign nationals, many of whom work in the aid industry as well as diplomats, representatives of religious organisations and some business people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
