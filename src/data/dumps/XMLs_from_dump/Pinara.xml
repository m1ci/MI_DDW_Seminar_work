'''Pinara''' ([[Lycian language|Lycian]]: êäìêäÜêäçêäçêäÅêäëêäèêäÜ ''Pille√±ni'', presumably from the adjective &quot;round&quot;; {{lang-el|œÑ·Ω∞ Œ†ŒØŒΩŒ±œÅŒ±}}, formerly ''Artymnesus'' or ''Artymnesos'' according to one account) was a large city of [[ancient Lycia]] at the foot of [[Mount Cragus]] (now [[Babadaƒü (mountain)|Mount Babadaƒü]]), and not far from the western bank of the [[River Xanthos]], homonymous with the ancient city of [[Xanthos]] (now [[E≈üen Stream]]).

The remains of several ancient temples can be seen in Pinara, as well as rock tombs including one &quot;royal tomb&quot;, an upper and a lower [[acropolis]], a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]], an [[Odeon (building)|odeon]], an [[agora]] and a church. The name Pinara has somewhat been assimilated to the name of the present-day village of [[Minare]], half an hour below the ruins and depending [[Fethiye]] district of [[Muƒüla Province]], [[Turkey]].

==Name==
[[File:Pinara Ancient Lycian City.JPG|thumb|Crag with rock-cut tombs towering over Pinara situated on a &quot;round&quot; mass of rock, believed to have given the ancient city its name.]]
There was a cult of [[Pandarus]], the Lycian hero of the [[Trojan War]], in Pinara, which led some sources to conclude that he was a native of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] xiv. 665; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s.v. ''Artymnesos''; [[Arrian]], ''Anab.'' i. 24; [[Pliny the Elder]], v. 28; [[Ptolemy]] v. 3. ¬ß 5; [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] p. 684.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lycian history of [[Menecrates of Ephesus|Menecrates]], quoted by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]]{{sfn|Smith|1854|p=11}}&lt;ref&gt;Styephanus, ''s.v.'' Artymnesos {{lang|grc|·ºàœÅœÑœçŒºŒΩŒ∑œÉŒøœÇ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the city was a colony of [[Xanthos]], its original name would be ''Artymnesos''. This name would have preceded the [[Lycian language]] name Pinara, derived from the form &quot;Pille√±ni&quot; or &quot;Pinale&quot; meaning a &quot;round hill&quot; or simply &quot;round&quot;,{{sfn|Smith|1854|p=11}} based on a hypothesis of interchange of [[liquid consonant]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The town is indeed situated on such a great round mass of rock and a more or less circular crag towers over the ruins. Another source, [[Panyassis]], also mentions an eponymous founder by name Pinarus, son of [[Tremiles]] or Termilus, and this account is viewed by some sources as unsubstantial as the rest relating to the precedence of names.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==History==
The city, though not often mentioned by ancient writers, appears from its vast and beautiful ruins to have been, as [[Strabo]] asserts, one of Lycia's largest, its chief port city until the harbor silted up to form the reed-filled wetlands of today.{{sfn|Smith|1854|p=11}}

Yet another rare mention of the city in ancient sources is in connection with the help it provided, along with several other Lycian cities, to [[Pixodarus of Caria]].

Pinara was a member of the [[Lycian League]], in which it held three votes. The city surrendered to [[Alexander the Great]] in 334&amp;nbsp;BCE. After Alexander's death, the city fell to the kingdom of [[Pergamum]]. Pinara became a Roman city when Pergamum was willed by its last king [[Attalus III]] to the [[Roman Republic]] in 133&amp;nbsp;BCE. The city enjoyed prosperity during Roman rule, but was badly damaged by [[141 Lycia earthquake|earthquakes in 141]] and 240&amp;nbsp;CE. In the first occurrence, the city is recorded to have received a contribution from [[Opramoas]] for the repair of public buildings.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Pinara was [[Christianized]] early. Five bishops are known: Eustathius, who signed the formula of Acacius of C√¶sarea at the [[Council of Seleucia]] in 359; Heliodorus, who signed the letter from the bishops of Lycia to the emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] (458); Zenas, present at the [[Quinisext Council|Trullan Council]] (692); Theodore, at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787); Athanasius, at the synod that reinstated [[Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople]] (the Photian Council) in 879. Pinara was the birthplace of [[Nicolas of Myra]]. Under repeated pressure from invading forces, the city lost its inhabitants in the ninth century.{{sfn|P√©trid√®s|1911}}

==Scientific discovery==
Pinara's ruins were identified by [[Sir Charles Fellows]].{{sfn|Smith|1854|p=11}} From amidst the ancient city, he says,{{sfn|Fellows|2005|p=136}} rises a singular round rocky cliff (the ''pinara'' of the Lycians), literally speckled all over with tombs. Beneath this cliff lie the ruins of the extensive and splendid city. The theater is in a very perfect state; all the seats are remaining, with the slanting sides towards the proscenium, as well as several of its doorways. The walls and several of the buildings are of the [[Cyclopean architecture|Cyclopean masonry]], with massive gateways formed of three immense stones. The tombs are innumerable, and the inscriptions are in the Lycian characters, but Greek also occurs often on the same tombs. Some of these rock-tombs are adorned with fine and rich sculptures.

The Christian bishopric of Pinara, no longer a residential see, is included in the [[Catholic Church]]' list of [[titular see]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 953&lt;/ref&gt;
