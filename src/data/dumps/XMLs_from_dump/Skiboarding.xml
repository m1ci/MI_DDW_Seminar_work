'''Skiboarding''' is a type of [[freestyle skiing]] using short, usually double-tipped skis, regular [[ski boot]]s and [[Ski binding|bindings]], and no [[Ski pole|poles]]. It is also known as ''snowblading'' or ''skiblading''. It is a recreational sport with no governing body or competition.

The first mass produced skiboard was the Austrian [[Kneissl]] Bigfoot in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Skiboarding |url=https://skiboards.eu/en/content/8-about-skiboarding |website=skiboards.eu |accessdate=28 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; American manufacturers such as [[Line Skis]] then began to produce skiboards, and the sport grew in popularity. From 1998 to 2000, skiboarding was part of the winter [[X Games]] in the [[slopestyle]] event. After it was dropped there was no longer a profession circuit for the sport, and many competitors switched to [[freestyle skiing]] on [[twin-tip ski]]s. 

Today skiboards are available from major brands such as [[K2 Sports|K2]], [[Atomic Skis|Atomic]], [[Elan (company)|Elan]], [[Head (company)|Head]], and [[Salomon Group|Salomon]]. 

Skiboards are from about 75 to 135 cm in length, with a parabolic shape like a [[snowboard]], and a solid wood core.&lt;ref name=&quot;skiboards&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://skiboards.com/frequently-asked-questions/ |website=skiboards.com |accessdate=28 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Length and width are a function of rider weight, skiing style, and conditions.
