'''Ashkelon''' or '''Ashqelon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ʃ|k|ə|l|ɒ|n}}; {{lang-he-n|{{Audio|Ashkelon.ogg|אַשְׁקְלוֹן|help=no}}}}, {{IPA-he|aʃkeˈlon|}}), also known as '''Ascalon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|k|ə|l|ɒ|n}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀσκάλων}}, ''Askálōn''; {{lang-ar|عَسْقَلَان}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿAsqalān}}''), is a coastal city in the [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District]] of [[Israel]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, {{convert|50|km}} south of [[Tel Aviv]], and {{convert|13|km}} north of the border with the [[Gaza Strip]]. The ancient seaport of Ashkelon dates back to the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]]. In the course of its history, it has been ruled by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Canaan]]ites, the [[Philistines]], the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[Babylonia]]ns, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], the [[Phoenicia]]ns, the [[Hasmoneans]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the [[Arabs]] and the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], until it was destroyed by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] in 1270.

The Arab village of '''al-Majdal''' or '''al-Majdal Asqalan''' ({{lang-ar|المجدل}}; {{Lang-he-n|אֵל{{maqaf}}מִגְ{{geresh}}דַּל}}) was established a few kilometres inland from the ancient site by the late 15th century, under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In 1918, it became part of the British [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] and in 1920 became part of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Al-Majdal on the eve of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] had 10,000 Arab inhabitants and in October 1948, the city accommodated thousands more refugees from nearby villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masalha&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masalha|first1=Nur|authorlink1=Nur Masalha|title=The Palestine Nakba: Decolonising History, Narrating the Subaltern, Reclaiming Memory|date=2012|publisher=Zed Books, Limited|location=London|isbn=1848139705|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Majdal was the forward position of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] based in [[Gaza City|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CC7381HrLqcC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=majdal+egyptian+expeditionary+northernmost&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wlmgnJG9Ua&amp;sig=P1JDvozg_m-LHvD-A2Rx6kZzdWk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP55HtqsrPAhVE6WMKHQD_BjAQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=majdal%20egyptian%20expeditionary%20northernmost&amp;f=false|title=1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War|last=Morris|first=Benny|date=2008-10-01|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300145241|location=|pages=331|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village was conquered by Israeli forces on 5 November 1948, by which time most of the Arab population had fled,&lt;ref name=&quot;1948After&quot;&gt;B.

Most of the remaining Arabs were deported by 1950.{{cn|date=August 2019}}

In 1953, the nearby neighborhood of Afridar was incorporated and the name &quot;Ashkelon&quot; was readopted to the town. By 1961, Ashkelon was ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golan&quot;/&gt; In {{Israel populations|Year}} the population of Ashkelon was {{Israel populations|Ashqelon}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

==Etymology==
The name Ashkelon is probably [[West Semitic languages|western Semitic]], and might be connected to the [[triliteral root]] ''š-q-l'' (&quot;to weigh&quot; from a Semitic root ''ṯql'', akin to Hebrew ''šāqal'' {{lang|he|שָקַל}} or Arabic ''θiql'' {{lang|ar|ثِقْل}} &quot;weight&quot;) perhaps attesting to its importance as a center for mercantile activities. Its name appeared in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and [[Punic language|Punic]] as {{sc|šqln}} ({{lang|phn|𐤔𐤒𐤋𐤍}}) and {{sc|ʾšqln}} ({{lang|phn|𐤀𐤔𐤒𐤋𐤍}}).{{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&amp;pg=PA560 560]}} ''[[Scallion]]'' and ''[[shallot]]'' are derived from ''Ascalonia'', the [[Latin]] name for Ashkelon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== History ==
Ashkelon was the oldest and largest seaport in [[Canaan]], part of the [[pentapolis]] (a grouping of five cities) of the [[Philistines]], north of [[Gaza (city)|Gaza]] and south of [[Jaffa]].

===Neolithic era===
[[File:Ashkelon Pre-Pottery Neolithic C site.jpg|thumb|200px|Archaeological site with artifacts from the Neolithic era]]
The [[Neolithic]] site of Ashkelon is located on the [[Mediterranean coast]], {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} north of Tel Ashkelon. It is dated by [[Radiocarbon dating]] to c.{{nbsp}}7900 bp (uncalibrated), to the poorly known Pre-Pottery Neolithic C phase of the Neolithic. It was discovered and excavated in 1954 by French archaeologist [[Jean Perrot]]. In 1997–1998, a large scale salvage project was conducted at the site by [[Yosef Garfinkel]] on behalf of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and nearly {{convert|1,000|sqm}} were examined. A final excavation report was published in 2008.

In the site over a hundred fireplaces and [[hearth]]s were found and numerous pits, but no solid architecture, except for one wall. Various phases of occupation were found, one atop the other, with sterile layers of sea sand between them. This indicates that the site was occupied on a seasonal basis.
[[File:Ashkelon Pre-Pottery Neolithic C flint arrowheads.jpg|thumb|200px|Ashkelon Pre-Pottery Neolithic C flint arrowheads]]
The main finds were enormous quantities of c.{{nbsp}}100,000 animal bones and c.{{nbsp}}20,000 [[flint]] artifacts. Usually at Neolithic sites flints far outnumber animal bones. The bones belong to [[Domestication|domesticated]] and non-domesticated animals. When all aspects of this site are taken into account, it appears to have been used by [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomads]] for meat processing. The nearby sea could supply salt necessary for the [[Curing (food preservation)|conservation]] of meat.

===Canaanite settlement===
[[File:Restored Canaanite city gate of Ashkelon (14341997262).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Restored Canaanite city gate of Ashkelon&lt;ref name=gate/&gt; (2014)]]
[[File:Ashkelon - jsqAr(w)ny.gif|thumb|250px|''Ashqelon'' as mentioned on [[Merneptah Stele]]: it reads &lt;jsq3rwny&gt; /'Asqaluni/ (with two determinatives)]]
The city was originally built on a [[sandstone]] outcropping and has a good underground [[water supply]]. It was relatively large as an ancient city with as many as 15,000 people living inside the walls. Ashkelon was a thriving Middle [[Bronze Age]] (2000–1550 BCE) city of more than {{convert|150|acres|0|abbr=on}}. Its commanding [[Defensive wall|ramparts]], measuring {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} long, {{convert|50|ft|m}} high and {{convert|150|ft|m}} thick,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, and even as a ruin they stand two stories high. The thickness of the walls was so great that the mudbrick [[city gate]] had a stone-lined, {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide tunnel-like [[barrel vault]], coated with white plaster, to support the superstructure: it is the oldest such [[vault (architecture)|vault]] ever found.&lt;ref name=gate&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814034938/http://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Around-Israel/Oldest-arched-gate-in-the-world-restored|archivedate=August 14, 2013|url=http://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Around-Israel/Oldest-arched-gate-in-the-world-restored|accessdate=January 21, 2018|title=Oldest arched gate in the world restored|first=Etgar|last=Lefkovits|date=April 8, 2008|location=[[Jerusalem]]|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Roman and Islamic fortifications, faced with stone, followed the same footprint, a vast semicircle protecting Ashkelon on the land side. On the sea it was defended by a high natural bluff. A roadway more than {{convert|20|ft|m}} in width ascended the rampart from the harbor and entered a gate at the top.

In 1991 the ruins of a small ceramic tabernacle was found a finely cast bronze statuette of a bull calf, originally silvered, {{convert|4|in|cm}} long. Images of calves and bulls were associated with the worship of the Canaanite gods [[El (deity)|El]] and [[Baal]].

Ashkelon is mentioned in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Execration Texts]] of the 11th dynasty as &quot;Asqanu.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01460.html |title=Ashkelon, Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=2011-08-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053009/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01460.html| archivedate= 17 July 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Amarna letters]] ({{circa}} 1350 BC), there are seven letters to and from Ashkelon's (Ašqaluna) king [[Yidya]], and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]]. One letter from the pharaoh to Yidya was discovered in the early 1900s.

===Philistine settlement===
The Philistines conquered Canaanite Ashkelon about 1150 BCE. Their earliest pottery, types of structures and inscriptions are similar to the early Greek urbanised centre at [[Mycenae]] in mainland [[Greece]], adding weight to the hypothesis that the Philistines were one of the populations among the &quot;[[Sea Peoples]]&quot; that upset cultures throughout the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] at that time.

Ashkelon became one of the five Philistine cities that were constantly warring with the [[Israelites]] and later the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel]] and successive [[Kingdom of Judah]]. According to [[Herodotus]], its temple of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was the oldest of its kind, imitated even in [[Cyprus]], and he mentions that this temple was pillaged by marauding [[Scythians]] during the time of their sway over the [[Medes]] (653–625 BC). As it was the last of the Philistine cities to hold out against [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian king]] [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]. When it fell in 604 BC, burnt and destroyed and its people taken into exile, the Philistine era was over.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Classical period===
[[File:Ask Sarcopag.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ancient sarcophagus in Ashkelon]]
Ashkelon was soon rebuilt. Until the conquest of [[Alexander the Great]], Ashkelon's inhabitants were influenced by the dominant [[Persia]]n culture. It is in this archaeological layer that excavations have found dog burials. It is believed the dogs may have had a sacred role, however evidence is not conclusive. After the conquest of Alexander in the 4th century BC, Ashkelon was an important free city and [[Hellenistic]] seaport.

It had mostly friendly relations with the [[Hasmonean kingdom]] and [[Herodian kingdom]] of Judea, in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. In a significant case of an early [[witch-hunt]], during the reign of the Hasmonean queen [[Salome Alexandra]], the court of [[Simeon ben Shetach]] sentenced to death eighty women in Ashkelon who had been charged with [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yerushalmi [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'', 6:6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herod the Great]], who became a client king of Rome over Judea and its surrounds in 30 BCE, had not received Ashkelon, yet he built monumental buildings there: bath houses, elaborate fountains and large colonnades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pace-ancient.mcmaster.ca/york/york/placePopup?id=24&amp;descOnly=|title=Ashkelon|publisher=Project on Ancient Cultural Engagement/Brill|access-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904060244/http://pace-ancient.mcmaster.ca/york/york/placePopup?id=24&amp;descOnly=|archive-date=4 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first = A | last = NEGEV | encyclopedia = The Princeton encyclopedia of classical sites | editor1-last = Stillwell | editor1-first = Richard. | editor2-last = MacDonald | editor2-first = William L. | editor3-last = McAlister | editor3-first = Marian Holland | place = Princeton, N.J. | publisher = Princeton University Press| year = 1976 | via = [[Perseus Digital Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discredited tradition suggests Ashkelon has been his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ecf/201/2010033.htm | title = The Church History of Eusebius | chapter = VI | at = §2, notes 90-91 | author = Eusebius | authorlink = Eusebius | editor-first =  Arthur Cushman | editor-last = McGiffert | editor-link =Arthur Cushman McGiffert | series = Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, series II | date = 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 6 CE, when a [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman imperial province]] was set in Judea, overseen by a lower-rank governor, Ashkelon was moved directly to the higher jurisdiction of the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria province]].

The city remained loyal to Rome during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Great Revolt]], 66–70 AD.

===Byzantine period===

The city of Ascalon appears on a fragment of the 6th century AD [[Madaba Map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbGEngEACAAJ&amp;dq=Donner+%28The+Mosaic+Map+of+Madaba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gB-DVILLNsbyUtj_gbgN&amp;redir_esc=y |first=Herbert |last=Donner |title=The Mosaic Map of Madaba |publisher=Kok Pharos Publishing House |year=1992 |isbn=978-90-3900011-3 |pages=64–65}} quoted in [http://198.62.75.1/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/103discuss.html The Madaba Mosaic Map: Ascalon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishops of Ascalon whose names are known include Sabinus, who was at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, and his immediate successor, Epiphanius. Auxentius took part in the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381, Jobinus in a synod held in Lydda in 415, Leontius in both the [[Robber Council of Ephesus]] in 449 and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. Bishop Dionysius, who represented Ascalon at a synod in Jerusalem in 536, was on another occasion called upon to pronounce on the validity of a baptism with sand in waterless desert and sent the person to be baptized in water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bellarmino Bagatti|Bagatti]], ''Ancient Christian Villages of Judaea and Negev'', quoted in [http://198.62.75.1/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/103discuss.html The Madaba Mosaic Map: Ascalon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;452&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer a residential bishopric, Ascalon is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 840&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Islamic period===
During the Muslim conquest of Palestine begun in {{circa|633–634}}, Ascalon (called ''Asqalan'' by the Arabs) became one of the last Byzantine cities to fall in the region.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=710}} It may have been temporarily occupied by [[Amr ibn al-As]], but definitively surrendered to [[Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan]] (who later founded the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]) not long after he captured the Byzantine district capital of [[Caesarea]] in {{circa|640}}.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=710}} The Byzantines reoccupied Asqalan during the [[Second Muslim Civil War]] (680–692) but the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|685|705}}) recaptured and fortified it.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=710}} A son of Caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]], whose family resided in [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]], was buried in the city.{{sfn|Lecker|1989|p=35, note 109}} An inscription found in the city indicates that the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Mahdi]] ordered the construction of a mosque with a minaret in Asqalan in 772.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=710}} 

===Fatimids, Crusaders, Ayyubids and Mamluks===
[[File:Battle of Ascalon-engraving.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Battle of Ascalon]], 1099]]

Asqalan prospered under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and contained a mint and secondary naval base.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=710}} Along with a few other coastal towns in Palestine, it remained in Fatimid hands when most of [[Bilad al-Sham|Islamic Syria]] was conquered by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]].{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=710}} However, during this period, Fatimid rule over Asqalan was periodically reduced to nominal authority over the city's governor.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=710}} In 1098, the [[Fatimid vizier]] [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] built a ''[[Mazar (mausoleum)|mashhad]]'' (mausoleum) for the head of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], a grandson of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], which was buried in the city.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=711}} The mausoleum was described as the most magnificent building in Ashkelon.&lt;ref&gt;{{A History of Palestine, 634–1099|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the British Mandate period it was a &quot;large ''maqam'' on top of a hill&quot; with no tomb, but a fragment of a pillar showing the place where the head had been buried.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canaan&quot;&gt;Canaan, 1927, p. [https://archive.org/details/MohammedanSaintsAndSanctuariesInPalestine/page/n161/mode/1up  151]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1950, the shrine was destroyed at the instructions of [[Moshe Dayan]] in accordance with a 1950s Israeli policy of erasing Muslim historical sites within Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Meron Rapoport, ''History Erased'', [[Haaretz]], 5 July 2007. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/878851.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Crusades]], Asqalan (known to the Crusaders as ''Ascalon'') was an important city due to its location near the coast and between the [[Crusader states|Crusader States]] and Egypt. In 1099, shortly after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of Jerusalem]], a Fatimid army that had been sent to relieve [[Jerusalem]] was defeated by a Crusader force at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. The city itself was not captured by the Crusaders because of internal disputes among their leaders. This battle is widely considered to have signified the end of the [[First Crusade]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} As a result of military reinforcements from Egypt and a large influx of refugees from areas conquered by the Crusaders, Asqalan became a major Fatimid frontier post.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=711}} The Fatimids utilized it to launch raids into the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|pp=710–711}} Trade ultimately resumed between Asqalan and Crusader-controlled Jerusalem, though the inhabitants of Asqalan regularly struggled with shortages in food and supplies, necessitating the provision of goods and relief troops to the city from Egypt on several occasions each year.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=711}} According to [[William of Tyre]], the entire civilian population of the city was included in the Fatimid army registers.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=711}} The Crusaders' capture of the port city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in 1134 and their construction of a ring of fortresses around the city to neutralize its threat to Jerusalem strategically weakened Asqalan.{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=711}} In 1150 the Fatimids fortified the city with fifty-three towers, as it was their most important frontier fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gore|first=Rick |date=January 2001   |title=Ancient Ashkelon|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/features/world/asia/israel/ashkelon-text |magazine=National Geographic |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, after a [[Siege of Ascalon|seven-month siege]], the city was captured by a Crusader army led by King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=711}} The Fatimids secured the head of Husayn from its mausoleum in the city and transported it to their capital [[Cairo]].{{sfn|Hartmann|Lewis|1960|p=711}} Ascalon was then added to the [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon|County of Jaffa]] to form the [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon]], which became one of the four major seigneuries of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Crusader conquest of Jerusalem]] the six elders of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] Jewish community in Ashkelon contributed to the ransoming of captured Jews and holy relics from Jerusalem's new rulers. The [[Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon]], which was sent to the Jewish elders of Alexandria, describes their participation in the ransom effort and the ordeals suffered by many of the freed captives. A few hundred Jews, Karaites and Rabbanites, were living in Ashkelon in the second half of the 12th century, but moved to Jerusalem when the city was destroyed in 1191.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carmel&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Alex Carmel, Peter Schäfer and Yossi Ben-Artzi | title = The Jewish Settlement in Palestine, 634–1881 | series = Beihefte zum Tübinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients : Reihe B, Geisteswissenschaften; Nr. 88 | location = Wiesbaden | publisher = Reichert | year = 1990 | page = 24,31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sey'd Hussein Shrine1b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Muslim pilgrims to the Shrine of Seyid Hussein, April 1943.]]
In 1187, [[Saladin]] took Ashkelon as part of his conquest of the [[Crusader states|Crusader States]] following the [[Battle of Hattin]]. In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], Saladin demolished the city because of its potential strategic importance to the Christians, but the leader of the Crusade, King [[Richard I of England]], constructed a citadel upon the ruins. Ashkelon subsequently remained part of the diminished territories of Outremer throughout most of the 13th century and [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard, Earl of Cornwall]] reconstructed and refortified the citadel during 1240–41, as part of the Crusader policy of improving the defences of coastal sites. The [[Egypt]]ians retook Ashkelon in 1247 during [[As-Salih Ayyub]]'s conflict with the Crusader States and the city was returned to Muslim rule. The [[Mamluk]] dynasty came into power in Egypt in 1250 and the ancient and [[Middle Ages|medieval history]] of Ashkelon was brought to an end in 1270, when the Mamluk sultan [[Baibars|Baybars]] ordered the citadel and harbour at the site to be destroyed. As a result of this destruction, the site was abandoned by its inhabitants and fell into disuse.

The Arab village of Majdal was mentioned by historians and tourists at the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orna&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Orna Cohen | title = &quot;Transferred to Gaza of Their Own Accord&quot; The Arabs of Majdal in Ashkelon and their Evacuation to the Gaza Strip in 1950 | publisher = The Harry S.

An official Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that  ''Medschdel''  had a total of 420 houses and a population of 1175, though the population count included men only.&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p.

=== Mandatory Palestine ===
The  [[1931 census of Palestine|census of 1931]]  found 6,166 Muslims and 41 Christians living there.&lt;ref name=PalestineStats&gt;Palestine Office of Statistics, Vital Statistical Tables 1922–1945, Table A8.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948, the population had grown to about 11,000.

Majdal was especially known for its weaving industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Palestinian costumes]]&lt;/ref&gt; The town had around 500 looms in 1909. In 1920 a British Government report estimated that there were 550 cotton looms in the town with an annual output worth 30-40,000,000 [[French Franc|Francs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.M. Stationery Office (1920) ''Syria and Palestine&quot; — Viewer — World Digital Library |url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11774/view/1/1/#q=Israel |website=www.wdl.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the industry suffered from imports from Europe and by 1927 only 119 weaving establishments remained. The three major fabrics produced were &quot;malak&quot; (silk), 'ikhdari' (bands of red and green) and 'jiljileh' (dark red bands). These were used for festival dresses throughout Southern Palestine. Many other fabrics were produced, some with poetic names such as ''ji'nneh u nar'' (&quot;heaven and hell&quot;), ''nasheq rohoh'' (&quot;breath of the soul&quot;) and ''abu mitayn'' (&quot;father of two hundred&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Shelagh Weir, &quot;Palestinian Costume&quot;. British Museum Publications, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-1597-9}}. pages 27–32. Other fabrics produced include ''Shash'' (white muslin for veils), ''Burk''/''Bayt al-shem'' (plain cotton for underdresses), ''Karnaish'' (white cotton with stripes), &quot;Bazayl&quot; (flannelette), ''Durzi'' (blue cotton) and ''Dendeki'' (red cotton).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
During the 1948 war, the Egyptian army occupied a large part of Gaza including Majdal. Over the next few months, the town was subjected to Israeli air-raids and shelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;1948After&quot;/&gt; All but about 1,000 of the town's residents were forced to leave by the time it was captured by Israeli forces as a sequel to [[Operation Yoav]] on 4 November 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;1948After&quot;/&gt; General [[Yigal Allon]] ordered the expulsion of the remaining Palestinians but the local commanders did not do so and the Arab population soon recovered to more than 2,500 due mostly to refugees slipping back and also due to the transfer of Palestinians from nearby villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;1948After&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orna&quot;/&gt; Most of them were elderly, women, or children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orna&quot;/&gt; During the next year or so, the Palestinians were held in a confined area surrounded by barbed wire, which became commonly known as the &quot;ghetto&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/714003467 | author=Golan, Arnon | title=Jewish Settlement of Former Arab Towns and their Incorporation into the Israeli Urban System (1948–1950) | journal=Israel Affairs | year=2003 | volume=9 | pages=149–164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orna&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MorrisBirth&quot;&gt;Morris, 2004, pp.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&amp;pg=PA528 528] –529.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moshe Dayan]] and Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] were in favor of expulsion, while [[Mapam]] and the Israeli labor union [[Histadrut]] objected.&lt;ref name=&quot;1948After&quot;/&gt; The government offered the Palestinians positive inducements to leave, including a favorable currency exchange, but also caused panic through night-time raids.&lt;ref name=&quot;1948After&quot;/&gt; The first group was deported to the [[Gaza Strip]] by truck on 17 August 1950 after an expulsion order had been served.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabri Jiryis|S.

Ashkelon was formally granted to Israel in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]. Re-population of the recently vacated Arab dwellings by Jews had been official policy since at least December 1948, but the process began slowly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golan&quot;/&gt;  The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional [[Urban area|urban center]] of 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golan&quot;/&gt; From July 1949, new immigrants and [[demobilization|demobilized]] soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golan&quot;/&gt; These early immigrants were mostly from [[Yemen]], [[North Africa]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=he:מגדל־גד בהתפתחותה,בחירות ב־26 בפברואר - דבר, |url=http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=o9Sbi1WIsHdoejWFtHsh3QLn0DMAzo4d0FWipSdDt34n%2BE0l6hHZL8hFphABg7HQYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=DAV%2f1950%2f02%2f10&amp;page=9&amp;rtl=true |website=jpress.org.il |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BENZAQUEN |first1=JOHN |title=Neighborhood Watch: Ashkelon’s ‘Anglo quarter’ |url=https://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Around-Israel/Neighborhood-Watch-Ashkelons-Anglo-quarter |website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted [[Local council (Israel)|local council]] status in 1953. In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golan&quot;/&gt; This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983. In 2005, the population was more than 106,000.

On 1–2 March 2008, rockets fired by [[Hamas]] from the [[Gaza Strip]] (some of them [[BM-21#Gaza|Grad rockets]]) hit Ashkelon, wounding seven, and causing [[property damage]]. Mayor Roni Mahatzri stated that &quot;This is a [[Declaration of war|state of war]], I know no other definition for it.

On 12 May 2008, a rocket fired from the northern Gazan city of [[Beit Lahia|Beit Lahiya]] hit a shopping mall in southern Ashkelon, causing significant structural damage. According to ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', four people were seriously injured and 87 were treated for [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|shock]]. 15 people suffered minor to moderate injuries as a result of the collapsed structure.

In 1949 and 1950, three immigrant transit camps ([[ma'abarot]]) were established alongside Majdal (renamed Migdal) for Jewish refugees from [[Arab world|Arab countries]], [[Romania]] and Poland. Northwest of Migdal and the immigrant camps, on the lands of the depopulated  [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]  village [[al-Jura]],&lt;ref name=Khalidi117&gt;Khalidi, 1992, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; entrepreneur [[Zvi Segal]], one of the signatories of Israel's Declaration of Independence, established the upscale Barnea neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Margalit |first=Talia |url=http://www.haaretz.com/general/periphery-without-a-center-1.107172 |title=Periphery without a center|work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large tract of land south of Barnea was handed over to the trusteeship of the South African Zionist Federation, which established the neighborhood of Afridar. Plans for the city were drawn up in South Africa according to the [[Garden city movement|garden city]] model. Migdal was surrounded by a broad ring of orchards. Barnea developed slowly, but Afridar grew rapidly. The first homes, built in 1951, were inhabited by new Jewish immigrants from [[South Africa]] and South America, with some native-born Israelis. The first public housing project for residents of the transit camps, the Southern Hills Project (Hageva'ot Hadromiyot) or Zion Hill (Givat Zion), was built in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz.com&quot;/&gt;

Under a plan signed in October 2015, seven new neighborhoods comprising 32,000 housing units, a new stretch of highway, and three new highway interchanges will be built, turning Ashkelon into the sixth-largest city in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Media |first1=JNi |title=With 32,000 New Housing Units Ashkelon to Become Israel’s 6th Largest City |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/with-32000-new-housing-units-ashkelon-to-become-israels-6th-largest-city/2015/10/30/ |website=www.jewishpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, the city was primarily settled by [[Mizrahi Jews]], who fled to Israel after being [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|expelled from Muslim lands]]. Today, [[Mizrahi Jews]] still constitute the majority of the population. In the early 1950s, many [[South African Jews]] settled in Ashkelon, establishing the [[Afridar]] neighbourhood. They were followed by an influx of [[British Jews|immigrants from the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbn.org.il/communities/template/community/152 |title=Nefesh b'Nefesh community guide |publisher=Nbn.org.il |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=2011-08-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718153013/http://www.nbn.org.il/communities/template/community/152| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, the city received additional arrivals of [[Ethiopian Jews]] and [[Russian Jews]].
