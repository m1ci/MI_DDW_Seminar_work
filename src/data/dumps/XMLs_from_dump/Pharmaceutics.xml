'''Pharmaceutics''' is the discipline of [[pharmacy]] that deals with the process of turning a [[new chemical entity]] (NCE) or old drugs into a medication to be used safely and effectively by patients.  It is also called the science of dosage form design.  There are many chemicals with [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] properties, but need special measures to help them achieve therapeutically relevant amounts at their sites of action.
