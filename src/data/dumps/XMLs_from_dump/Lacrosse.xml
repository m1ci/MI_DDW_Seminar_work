Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: [[field lacrosse]], [[women's lacrosse]], box lacrosse and [[intercrosse]]. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], shoulder pads, and elbow pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://worldlacrosse.sport/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FIL-MF-RB-2019-2020A4v1.03.pdf|title=FIL Rules of Men's Field Lacrosse, 2019-2020|year=2018|publisher= The Federation of International Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortin2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Francois Fortin|title=Sports: The Complete Visual Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ny_rBy0mT7wC&amp;pg=PA229|year=2000|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=978-1-55297-807-8|pages=229–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads.

Lacrosse is based on games played by various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] communities as early as 1100 AD.&lt;ref name=liss&gt;{{cite book |last=Liss |first=Howard |title=Lacrosse |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |year=1970 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, a version of lacrosse was well-established and was documented by [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] priests in the territory of present-day Canada.&lt;ref name=vennum&gt;{{cite book |last=Vennum |first=Thomas |title=American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |url=https://archive.org/details/americanindianla0000venn |url-access=registration |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year=2002 |isbn=978-1560983026 |via=[[Internet Archive]] }}{{page needed |date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional [[aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal Canadian]] version, each team consisted of about 100 to 1,000 men on a field several miles (several kilometers) long. These games lasted from sunup to sundown for two to three days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, or to give thanks to the Creator or Master.&lt;ref name=&quot;STX&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |title=Lacrosse History |accessdate=February 24, 2007 |publisher=[[STX (sports manufacturer)|STX]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524045912/http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |archivedate=May 24, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacrosse played a significant role in the community and religious life of tribes across the continent for many years. Early lacrosse was characterized by deep spiritual involvement, befitting the spirit of combat in which it was undertaken. Those who took part did so in the role of [[warriors]], with the goal of bringing glory and honor to themselves and their tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rock |first=Tom |title=More Than a Game |work=Lacrosse Magazine |publisher=[[US Lacrosse]] |date=November–December 2002 |url=http://redhawkslax.com/more-than-a-game-lacrosse-at-the-onondaga-nation-connects-the-current-generation-with-its-ancestors/ |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822224214/http://www.redhawkslax.com/news.lacrossemag.html |archivedate=August 22, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was said to be played &quot;for the Creator&quot; or was referred to as &quot;The Creator's Game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/lacrosse-the-creators-game/|title=Lacrosse, the Creator’s game|work=Oneida Indian Nation|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuit]] missionary {{lang|fr|[[Jean de Brébeuf]]|italic=no}} saw [[Wyandot people|Huron]] tribesmen play the game during 1637 in present-day [[Ontario]]. He called it {{lang|fr|la crosse}}, &quot;the stick&quot; in French.&lt;ref name=CAencyclopedia /&gt; The name seems to be originated from the French term for [[field hockey]], {{lang|fr|le jeu de la crosse}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991008114420/http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 8, 1999 |title=Lacrosse: E-Lacrosse Lacrosse History, Links and Sources |publisher=E-lacrosse.com |accessdate=February 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Smith (frontiersman)|James Smith]] described in some detail a game being played in 1757 by [[Mohawk people]] &quot;wherein now they used a wooden ball, about {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter, and the instrument they moved it with was a strong staff about {{convert|5|ft|m}} long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/accountofremarka00smit#page/76/mode/2up/ |title=An account of the remarkable occurrences in the life and travels of Colonel James Smith |location=Lexington |publisher=John Bradford |date=1799 |oclc=1038782222 |via=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=November 8, 2017 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglophones from Montreal noticed the game being played by [[Mohawk people]] and started playing themselves in the 1830s.&lt;ref name=CAencyclopedia /&gt; In 1856, [[William George Beers]], a Canadian dentist, founded the [[Montreal Lacrosse Club]].&lt;ref name=filhistory&gt;{{cite web |title=Origin &amp; History |url=https://filacrosse.com/fil/origin-history/ |publisher=[[Federation of International Lacrosse]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |editor-last=Claydon |editor-first=Jane }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, Beers codified the game, shortening the length of each game and reducing the number of players to 12 per team. The first game played under Beers's rules was at [[Upper Canada College]] in 1867; they lost to the [[Toronto Cricket Club]] by a score of 3–1.&lt;ref name=CAencyclopedia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lacrosse/ |title=Lacrosse |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |first=Barbara K. |last=Adamski }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new sport proved to be very popular and spread across the English-speaking world; [[list of the oldest lacrosse teams|by 1900 there were dozens of men's clubs]] in Canada, the United States, England, Australia, and New Zealand. The [[women's lacrosse#History|women's game was introduced]] by [[Louisa Lumsden]] in Scotland in 1890. The first women's club in the United States was started by [[Rosabelle Sinclair]] at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brynmawrschool.org/page/about/history |title=History |publisher=[[Bryn Mawr School]] |accessdate=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:From rattlesnake hunt to hockey page 121 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|[[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] &quot;Young Canadians&quot; lacrosse team, 1885.]]

In the United States, lacrosse during the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s was primarily a regional sport centered around the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], especially [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Maryland]]. However, in the last half of the 20th century, the sport spread outside this region, and can be currently found in most of the United States. According to a survey conducted by [[US Lacrosse]] in 2016, there are over 825,000 lacrosse participants nationwide and lacrosse is the fastest-growing team sport among [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] member schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;participation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Participation Survey |url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/about-us-lacrosse/participation-survey-2016.pdf |publisher=[[US Lacrosse]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions of lacrosse==

===Field lacrosse===
{{Main|Field lacrosse}}
[[File:Mens lacrosse diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of a men's college lacrosse field]]
Field lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the sport. There are ten players on each team: three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and one [[goaltender (field lacrosse)|goalie]]. Each player carries a [[lacrosse stick]]. A short stick measures between {{convert|40|and|42|in|cm}} long and is used by attackmen and midfielders. A maximum of four players on the field per team may carry a long stick which is between {{convert|52|and|72|in|cm}} long and is used by the three defensemen and sometimes one defensive midfielder. The goalie uses a stick with a head as wide as {{convert|12|in|cm}} that can be between {{convert|40|and|72|in|cm}} long.&lt;ref name=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Equipment for Boys' and Men's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment|publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of play is {{convert|110|by|60|yd|m}}. The goals are {{convert|6|by|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} and are {{convert|80|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart. Each goal sits inside a circular &quot;crease&quot;, measuring {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;field&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Field Diagrams|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/field-diagrams|publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goalie has special privileges within the crease to avoid opponents' stick checks. Offensive players or their sticks may not enter into the crease at any time. The mid-field line separates the field into an offensive and defensive zone for each team. Each team must keep four players in its defensive zone and three players in its offensive zone at all times. It does not matter which positional players satisfy the requirement, although usually the three attackmen stay in the offensive zone, the three defensemen and the goalie stay in the defensive zone, and the three middies play in both zones. A team that violates this rule is offsides and either loses possession of the ball if they have it or incurs a technical foul if they do not.&lt;ref name=mensrules&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/mens-rules |title=Men's Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Face-off.jpg|thumb|left|A face-off]]
The regulation playing time of a game is 60 minutes, divided into four periods of 15 minutes each.&lt;ref name=mensrules/&gt; Play is started at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal with a [[Face-off#Field lacrosse|face-off]]. During a face-off, two players lay their sticks on the ground parallel to the mid-line, the two heads of their sticks on opposite sides of the ball. At the whistle, the face-off-men scrap for the ball, often by &quot;clamping&quot; it under their stick and flicking it out to their teammates. When one of the teams has possession of the ball, they bring it into their offensive zone and try to score a goal. Due to the offsides rule, settled play involves six offensive players versus six defensive players and a goalie.&lt;ref name=&quot;basics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting started: Beginners Lacrosse 101|url=http://www.lacrosse.com/guide/getting-started-beginners-lacrosse-101/|website=Lacrosse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded against the team that touched it last. The exception is when the ball is shot towards the goal. Missed shots that go out of bounds are awarded to the team that has the player who is the closest to the ball when and where the ball goes out. During play, teams may substitute players in and out if they leave and enter the field through the substitution area, sometimes referred to as &quot;on the fly&quot;. After penalties and goals, players may freely substitute and do not have to go through the substitution area.&lt;ref name=boysrules&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/boys-rules |title=Boys' Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penalties are either technical or personal fouls. Personal fouls such as cross-checking, illegal body check or slashing, are about player safety. Cross-checking is when a player checks another player with their hands further than shoulder-width apart on the shaft. A slash is when a player swings his/her stick at another player uncontrollably, usually to the discretion of the referee. Even if he/she does not hit the player in possession, a flag can still be thrown. These fouls draw 1-minute or longer penalties; the offending player must leave the field and stay in the substitution area for the length of the penalty. Penalties are either releasable or non-releasable; releasable means that if a goal is scored by either team during the time that the penalty is served, the player serving the penalty can re-enter the play and both teams will once again have an equal number of players. Non-releasable means that the player must serve the entire time of the penalty, regardless of any goals scored. His team plays with nine players for the duration. Because of the offsides rule, this means the opponent plays with six attackers versus five defenders plus the goalie. Technical fouls, such as offsides, pushing, and holding, result in either a turnover or a 30-second penalty, depending on which team has the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;mensrules&quot; /&gt;

The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing [[shorthanded|man down]], while the other team is [[Power play (sporting term)#Lacrosse|man up]]. Teams will use various [[lacrosse strategy|lacrosse strategies]] to attack and defend while a player is being penalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;mensrules&quot; /&gt;

===Box lacrosse===
{{Main|Box lacrosse}}

[[File:Box Lacrosse.jpg|thumb|A game of box lacrosse in the NLL.]]
Box lacrosse is played by teams of five runners plus a goalie on a [[Ice hockey rink|hockey rink]] where the ice has been removed or covered by artificial turf, or in an indoor soccer field. The enclosed playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of the traditional game.&lt;ref name=&quot;lax-101&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nll.com/about/box-lax-101/ | title = Box Lax 101| accessdate = November 15, 2017 | publisher = [[National Lacrosse League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the game was introduced in Canada in the 1930s to promote business for hockey arenas outside of the ice hockey season.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite book |last= Fisher |first= Donald M. |year= 2002 |title= Lacrosse: A History of the Game |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N8dQ11uQxrQC&amp;lpg=PP1 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-6938-2 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=157}} Within several years it had nearly supplanted field lacrosse in Canada.&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;{{rp|page=120}}

The goals in box lacrosse are smaller than field lacrosse, traditionally {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and tall.  Also, the [[Goaltender (box lacrosse)|goaltender]] wears much more protective padding, including a massive chest protector and armguard combination known as &quot;uppers&quot;, large shin guards known as leg pads (both of which must follow strict measurement guidelines), and ice hockey-style goalie masks.&lt;ref name=&quot;lax-101&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Z4Laxx&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |title=Box Lacrosse Equipment Guideline |publisher=Zone4Laxx.com |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121180039/http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the game is quick, accelerated by the close confines of the floor and a [[shot clock]]. The shot clock requires the attacking team to take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;lax-101&quot;/&gt; Box lacrosse is also a much more physical game. Since cross checking is legal in box lacrosse, players wear rib pads and the shoulder and elbow pads are bigger and stronger than what field lacrosse players wear. Box lacrosse players wear a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse cage. There is no offsides in box lacrosse, the players substitute freely from their bench areas as in hockey. However, most players specialize in offense or defense, so usually all five runners substitute for teammates as their team transitions between offense and defense.&lt;ref name=explained&gt;{{YouTube |id=lZon8PxXQU4 |title=The Rules of Indoor Lacrosse / Box Lacrosse - EXPLAINED!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For penalties, the offending player is sent to the [[penalty box]] and his team has to play without him, or [[short handed|man-down]], for the length of the penalty. Most fouls are minor penalties and last for two minutes, major penalties for serious offenses last five minutes. What separates box lacrosse (and ice hockey) from other sports is that at the top levels of professional and junior lacrosse, participating in a fight does not automatically cause an ejection, but a five-minute major penalty is given.&lt;ref name=&quot;lax-101&quot;/&gt;

Box lacrosse is played at the highest level in the [[National Lacrosse League]] and by the Senior A divisions of the [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]]. The National Lacrosse League (NLL) employs some minor rule changes from the Canadian Lacrosse Association (CLA) rules. Notably, the goals are {{convert|4|ft|9|in|m}} wide instead of {{convert|4|ft|m}} and the games are played during the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;lax-101&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=nllrule/&gt; The NLL games consist of four fifteen-minute quarters compared with three periods of twenty minutes each in CLA games. NLL players may only use sticks with hollow shafts, while CLA permits solid wooden sticks.&lt;ref name=nllrule&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/wp-content/uploads/NLL2017Rulebook.pdf |title=National Lacrosse League 2017 Official Rules |publisher=National Lacrosse League |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vennum |first= Thomas |title= American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |url= https://archive.org/details/americanindianla0000venn |url-access= registration |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1560983026 |page= [https://archive.org/details/americanindianla0000venn/page/287 287]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's lacrosse===
[[File:2005 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship - Virginia Cavaliers vs Northwestern Wildcats.jpg|thumb|2005 [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship]]]]
{{Main|Women's lacrosse}}
The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's lacrosse, most notably by equipment and the degree of allowable physical contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIL women's rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2015-2018 Women's Official Rules|url=https://filacrosse.com/wp-content/downloads/women/Rules/FIL_WomensRuleBookJuly2017GAONLINE_Aug2017.pdf|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's lacrosse rules also differ significantly between the US and all other countries, who play by the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) rules. Women's lacrosse does not allow physical contact, the only protective equipment worn is a mouth guard and eye-guard. In the early part of the 21st century, there have been discussions of requiring headgear to prevent concussions. In 2008, Florida was the first state to mandate headgear in women's lacrosse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naplesnews.com/story/sports/high-school/lacrosse/2018/02/19/girls-lacrosse-fhsaa-hopes-helmets-cut-down-concussions/352069002/|title=Girls lacrosse: FHSAA hopes helmets will cut down on concussions|website=Naples Daily News|language=en|access-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stick checking is permitted in the women's game, but only in certain levels of play and within strict rules. Women's lacrosse also does not allow players to have a pocket, or loose net, on the lacrosse stick. Women start the game with a &quot;draw&quot; instead of a face-off. The two players stand up and the ball is placed between their stick heads while their sticks are horizontal at waist-height. At the whistle, the players lift their sticks into the air, trying to control where the ball goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.winnerslacrosse.org/blog/drawsvsfaceoffs|title=LACROSSE 101: DRAWS VS.

The first modern women's lacrosse game was held at [[St Leonards School]] in Scotland in 1890. It was introduced by the school's headmistress [[Louisa Lumsden]] after a visit to [[Quebec]], where she saw it played.&lt;ref name=lumsden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |title=History of Lacrosse at St Leonards |accessdate=May 1, 2008 |work=STLeonards-Fife.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506160603/http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |archivedate=May 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first women's lacrosse team in the United States was established at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hall of Fame to induct first woman Sinclair enters posthumously |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1993-02-06-1993037062-story.html |accessdate=14 August 2019 |work=baltimoresun.com |date=February 6, 1993 |ref=Sinclair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Women's lacrosse.GIF|thumb|left|Women's lacrosse field diagram]]
Both the number of players and the lines on the field differ from men's lacrosse. There are 12 players in women's lacrosse and players must abide by certain boundaries that do not exist in men's play. The three specific boundaries are the {{convert|8|m|ftin|adj=mid|sp=us}} &quot;fan&quot; in front of the goal ({{convert|11|m|ftin|abbr=on|sp=us|disp=sqbr}} internationally), the {{convert|12|m|ftin|adj=mid|sp=us}} ({{convert|8|m|ftin|abbr=on|sp=us|disp=sqbr}} internationally) half circle that surrounds the 8-meter fan, and the draw circle in the center of the field, which is used for draws to start quarters and after goals. The goal circle is also positioned slightly closer to the end line in women's lacrosse compared to men's. In women's lacrosse on either the offensive or defensive end, the players besides the goaltender are not able to step inside the goal circle; this becomes a &quot;goal-circle violation&quot;.  However, at the women's collegiate level, a new rule has been established that allows defenders to pass through the goal circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2019 Youth Girls' Rulebook |url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/rules/2019-girls-youth-rulebook.pdf |publisher=US Lacrosse |accessdate=14 August 2019 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8-meter fan that is in front of the goal circle has a few restrictions in it. Defenders cannot stand inside the 8-meter fan longer than 3 seconds without being a stick-length away from the offensive player they are guarding. This is very similar to the 
[[three-second rule]] in basketball. A three seconds violation results in a player from the other team taking a free shot against the goalie. If you are an attacker trying to shoot the ball into the goal, you are not supposed to take a shot while a defender is in &quot;shooting space.&quot; To make sure that you, the defender, are being safe, you want to lead with your [[lacrosse stick]] and once you are a sticks-length away, you can be in front of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/rules/2016-womens-rulebook.pdf |title=2016 Women's Rulebook |publisher=US Lacrosse |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercrosse===
{{main|Intercrosse}}
Intercrosse, or soft stick lacrosse, is a non-contact form of lacrosse with a standardized set of rules using modified lacrosse equipment. An intercrosse stick is different from a normal lacrosse stick, the head is made completely of plastic instead of leather or nylon pockets in traditional lacrosse sticks. The ball is larger, softer and hollow, unlike a lacrosse ball, which is solid rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competitions|url=http://inter-crosse.com/competitions/|publisher=FIIC|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intercrosse is a competitive adult sport is popular in Quebec, Canada, as well as in many European countries, particularly in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captain-lax.com/lacrosse-blog/2016/03/intercrosse-what-has-that-got-to-do-with-lacrosse/|title=Intercrosse – What has that got to do with lacrosse?|publisher=Captain Lax|access-date=August 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, teams consist of five players per side, and the field size is {{cvt|20|m|ft}} wide and {{cvt|40|m|ft}} long. Goals for adults are the same size as [[box lacrosse]], {{cvt|4|ft|m|disp=or}} in height and width.

An obstacle for lacrosse to return to the Olympics is insufficient international participation. To be considered for the Olympics, a sport must be played on four continents and by at least 75 countries.

==Equipment==

===Stick===
{{main|Lacrosse stick}}
[[File:Womens lacrosse stick head 2.jpg|thumb|170px|Women's lacrosse stick]]
The lacrosse stick has two parts, the head and the shaft. There are three parts to the head: the scoop, sidewall, and pocket. The scoop is the top of the stick that affects picking up ground ball as well as passing and shooting. The sidewall is the side of the head that affects the depth of the head and the stiffness. The pocket is the leather or nylon mesh attached to the sidewall and scoop. A wider pocket allows an easier time catching balls, but will also cause less ball control. A narrower pocket makes catching harder, but allows more ball retention and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacrosse.com/guide/lacrosse-heads-101/|title=LACROSSE HEADS 101|publisher=lacrosse.com|author=Chris Reid|date=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafts are usually made of hollow metal. They are octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], [[scandium]], or alloys, but some shafts are made from other materials, including wood, plastic, carbon fiber, or [[fiberglass]].

Stick length, both shaft and head together, is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men's sticks be from {{convert|40|to|42|in|cm}} long for offensive players, {{convert|52|to|72|in|cm}} long for defensemen, and {{convert|40|to|72|in|cm}} long for goalies.&lt;ref name=equipment /&gt;

Women's sticks must be an overall length of {{convert|35.5|-|43.25|in|cm}}. The head must be seven to nine inches wide and the top of the ball must remain above the side walls when dropped in the pocket. The goalkeeper's stick must be {{convert|35.5|-|48|in|cm}} long. The head of the goalie's stick can up to {{convert|12|in|cm}} wide and the pocket may be mesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equipment for Girls' and Women's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment#women|publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ball ===
{{main|Lacrosse ball}}
The ball is made of solid [[rubber]]. It is typically white for men's lacrosse, or yellow for women's Lacrosse; but is also produced in a wide variety of colors, such as yellow, orange or lime green according to the Men's Lacrosse Rules and Interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/LC16.pdf|title=2015 and 2016 Men's Lacrosse Rules and Interpretations|last=|first=|date=October 2014|website=NCAA Publications: 2015 and 2016 Men's Lacrosse Rules and Interpretations|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men's field protective equipment ===
Men's field lacrosse protective equipment contains a pair of [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], elbow pads, shoulder pads, [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], and mouthguard. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads to protect themselves from checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked and goalies usually wear no elbow pads due to the very limited opportunities of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.&lt;ref name=equipment /&gt;

===Men's box protective equipment===
Men's box players wear more protective gear than field players due to the increased physical contact and more permissive checking rules. Cross-checking in the back is allowed by the rules. Runners wear larger and heavier elbow pads and stronger shoulder pads that extend down the back of the player. Most players wear rib pads as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;player gear&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Box Lacrosse Equipment - Player Guidelines |url=https://www.mississaugatomahawkslacrosse.com/news_article/show/208112 |website=Mississauga Tomahawks Lacrosse |publisher=Ontario Lacrosse Association |accessdate=14 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Box goalies wear equipment very similar to ice hockey goalies, the leg blockers are somewhat smaller, although the shoulder pads are bigger than ice hockey pads.&lt;ref name=&quot;goalie gear&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Box Lacrosse Equipment - Goalie Guidelines |url=https://www.mississaugatomahawkslacrosse.com/news_article/show/208112 |website=Mississauga Tomahawks Lacrosse |publisher=Ontario Lacrosse Association |accessdate=14 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's field protective equipment===
Women's field players are not required to wear protective equipment besides eyegear and a mouthguard. Eyegear is a metal cage covering the eyes attached with a strap around the back of the head. In recent years, there has been discussion about allowing or requiring padded headgear to protect against concussions. Women goalies wear a helmet, gloves, and chest protector.&lt;ref name=equipment/&gt;
