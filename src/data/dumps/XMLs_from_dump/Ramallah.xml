It currently serves as the ''de facto'' administrative capital of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA). Ramallah was historically an [[Arab Christian]] town. [[Muslim]]s form the majority of the population of nearly 27,092 in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 PCBS Census&quot;/&gt; with Christians making up a significant minority.

==History==
[[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|Ancient rock-cut tombs]] have been found near Ramallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|Kitchener|1883|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potsherd]]s from the [[Crusader states|Crusader]]/[[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] and early Ottoman period have also been found there.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Lederman|1997|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramallah has been identified with the [[Crusader states|Crusader]] place called ''Ramalie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rey|1883|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prawer and Benvenisti, 1970, cited in Finkelstein and Lederman, 1997, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of a building with an [[arch]]ed doorway from the Crusader era, called ''al-Burj,'' have been identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pringle|1997|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the original use of the building is undetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pringle|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
Ramallah was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with all of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In 1596 it was listed in the [[Defter|tax registers]] as being in the ''[[nahiya]]'' of Quds, part of the ''[[Jerusalem Sanjak|Liwa of Quds]].'' It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 [[Muslim]] households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 [[akçe]]. All of the revenue went to a [[waqf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hütteroth|Abdulfattah|1977|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddad''ee''n), a clan of brothers descended from [[Ghassanids|Ghassanid]] [[Christians]]. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid El-Haddadin, arrived from east of the [[Jordan River]] from the areas of [[Al Karak|Karak]] and [[Shoubak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://ramallahlaoc.org/history.aspx American Federation of Ramallah Palestine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029233225/http://www.ramallahlaoc.org/history.aspx |date=October 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.

Rashid and his brothers were [[blacksmith]]s. The Haddadin name comes from the old ([[Aramaic]]ܚܕܕ or ܚܕܐܕ  ) word [[Haddad]], which translates to [[blacksmith]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Haddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the other mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

In 1838 American biblical scholar [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian &quot;of the Greek rite&quot;. There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village &quot;belonged&quot; to the [[Haram al-Sharif]], Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1841|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' described Ramallah as

&lt;blockquote&gt;A large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are [[Wakuf]], or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conder|Kitchener|1883|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

====Christian presence====

Ramallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village; thus, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Eastern [[Arab Orthodox|Greek Melkite Orthodox]] Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Greek Melkite Jerusalemite Orthodox Christian church was built. Later in the 1850s, &quot;The Church of Transfiguration&quot;, was built to replace it; it is the sole [[Orthodox Church]] in Ramallah today. During that same decade, the Latin (Roman Catholic) Church established its presence in Ramallah, constituting the second largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the [[St. Joseph]]'s Girls' School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school runs by Rosary sisters. With the influx of Muslim and Christian [[Palestinian refugees|refugees]] and internal migration, new mosques and churches were built.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the 19th century, the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]) established a presence in Ramallah and built the [[Ramallah Friends Schools]], one for girls and later a boys' school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened &quot;The Girls Training Home of Ramallah&quot; in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Beirut]]. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palfriends.org/schoolhistory.php |title=Religious Society of Friends (Palestine) |publisher=Palfriends.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029211841/https://www.palfriends.org/schoolhistory.php |archivedate=October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the school's official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional &quot;Tawjihi&quot; university exams.&lt;ref name=&quot;RamMuniRel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palfriends.org/fbs/history.asp |title=History of Friends School |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |work=Palestine Friends Boys School |publisher=Visuals Active Media |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071101091350/http://www.palfriends.org/fbs/history.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 1, 2007}} palfriends.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and [[Bethlehem]], a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Ramallah was declared a modern city in 1908. It had an elected municipality as well as partnership projects with the adjacent town of [[al-Bireh]]. [[Ramallah Friends Schools|The Friends Boys School]] became a temporary hospital during World War I.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===British Mandate===
The [[British Army]] occupied Ramallah in December 1917 during the war years. Following the First World War, it was designated as a mandate territory and under [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British rule]] until 1948. The economy improved in the 1920s, and the landed aristocracy and merchants of the Palestinian upper class built stately multi-storied villas, many of which still stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koolpages.com/wael2003/history.htm |title=From a Village to a Town |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223214116/http://www.koolpages.com/wael2003/history.htm |archivedate=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jerusalem Electric Company brought electricity to Ramallah in 1936, and most homes were wired shortly thereafter. The same year the British inaugurated the &quot;Palestine Broadcasting Service&quot; in Ramallah. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] trained the local staff to deliver daily broadcasts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and English. The station was later renamed &quot;[[Kol Yerushalayim]]&quot; (The Voice of Jerusalem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/radio.html |title=The History of Radio in Israel |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |work=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Ramallah was a center of activities against the British. Nancy Parker McDowell &lt;ref&gt;''Notes from Ramallah, 1939''. Friends United Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; describes vividly how the British attacked Ramallah using the Air Force. Many residents were killed and wounded. The wounded had to be transferred to Jerusalem since no significant medical facilities existed in Ramallah.

===Jordanian era===
[[File:Ramallah Residential.JPG|thumb|right|Residential neighborhood in Ramallah.]]
Following the creation of the State of Israel and the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|ensuing war]], Jordan seized the part of Palestine they named the West Bank. This included Ramallah. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian rule]] between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the [[West Bank]], Jordan, [[Lebanon]], and Syria. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. However, many Palestinians were jailed for being members of &quot;illegal political parties&quot;, which included the [[Palestine Communist Party]] and other socialist and pro-independence groups. By 1953, Ramallah's population had doubled, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. By 1956, about one fourth of Ramallah's 6,000 natives had left, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly [[Hebron]]) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
&lt;!-- Ramallah expatriates created one of the largest Arab communities in the United States, settling mainly in [[Washington]], New York, Florida, California, Texas, and especially in [[Michigan]]. Many worked in the auto industry. In 1959, the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine (AFRP) was established in [[Detroit]]. The AFRP has several branches in the United States, and holds an annual convention every summer attended by a sizable number of former Ramallah residents and their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koolpages.com/wael2003/history.htm|title=koolpages.com/wael2003/history|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrp.org/aboutus.aspx|title=afrp.org|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; will relocate to future demographics section (it has no relevance here whatsoever)--&gt;

===Israeli era===
During the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, [[Israel]] captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/english/Family_Separation/Origins.asp &quot;Creation of the problem of family separation in the Occupied Territories&quot;] [[Btselem]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003513/http://www.btselem.org/english/Family_Separation/Origins.asp |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For residents of Ramallah, the situation had now been reversed. For the first time in 19 years, residents could freely visit Israel and the [[Gaza Strip]] and engage in commerce there.

Unlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades.

The Israeli Civil Administration (CA), established in 1981, was in charge of civilian and day-to-day services such as issuing permission to travel, build, export or import, and host relatives from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmcc.org/research/special/military.html Israeli Military Orders in the Occupied Palestinian West Bank] Jerusalem Media and Communications Centre (JMCC), 2nd edition, pp.241. 1995 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712042326/http://www.jmcc.org/research/special/military.html |date=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CA reprinted Jordanian textbooks for distribution in schools but did not update them. The CA was in charge of tax collection and land expropriation, which sometimes included Israeli theft of olive groves that Arab villagers had tended for generations.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Salah. [http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/b43bb37dd727f0c0852570120072d4f6?Letter dated 25 May 1983 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011153642/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/b43bb37dd727f0c0852570120072d4f6?OpenDocument |date=October 11, 2013 }}, A/38/257-S/15810 of June 2, 1983&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestine-encyclopedia.com/EPP/Chapter18_3of10.htm |title=Encyclopedia of the Palestine Problem |last=Nakhleh |first=Issa |date=1991 |publisher=Palestine-encyclopedia.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927113622/http://www.palestine-encyclopedia.com/EPP/Chapter18_3of10.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as [[Beit El]] and [[Psagot]], prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Yehezkel |last1=Lein |first2=Eyal |last2=Weizman |url=http://www.brightonpalestinecampaign.org/pdfs/Articles/Land%20Grab.pdf |title=LAND GRAB: Israel’s Settlement Policy in the West Bank |website=Brightonpalestinecampaign.org |publisher=[[B'Tselem]] |date=May 2002 |format=PDF |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] were jailed or deported to neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE15/059/1999/en|title=ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES: Demolition and dispossession: the destruction of Palestinian homes |docket=MDE 15/59/99 |author=|date=8 December 1999|access-date=2 October 2018|first=Anthony |last=Coon|work=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1987, the popular uprising known as the [[First Intifada|Intifada]] erupted.

====First Intifada====
Ramallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmcc.org/research/reports/educate.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210223319/http://www.jmcc.org/research/reports/educate.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 10, 2007|title=JMCC / Research|date=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intifada leadership organized &quot;tree plantings&quot; and resorted to the tactics used in pre-1948 Palestine, such as ordering general strikes in which no commercial businesses were allowed to open and no cars were allowed on the streets.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1991, the Palestinian delegation to the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid International Peace Conference]] included many notables from Ramallah. As the Intifada wound down and the peace process moved forward, normal life in Ramallah resumed. On September 13, 1993 Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Palestinian Leader [[Yasser Arafat]] shook hands at a meeting at the [[White House]]. Schoolchildren in Ramallah handed out olive branches to Israeli soldiers patrolling the streets. In December 1995, in keeping with the [[Oslo Accords]], the Israeli army abandoned the [[Mukataa]] and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established [[Palestinian Authority]] assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated &quot;Area A&quot; under the accords.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Palestinian Authority rule===

====1990s====
The years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the &quot;Oslo Years&quot;) brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/dps/dps2002/dp2002-100.pdf Wider.unu.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102005327/http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/dps/dps2002/dp2002-100.pdf |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/said-end.html|title=The End of the Peace Process|work=The New York Times|date=2000|last=Said|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Said|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel Defense Forces]] remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to [[Jerusalem]] required special permits. The number and size of [[Israeli settlement]]s around Ramallah increased dramatically.

====Second Intifada====
Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads.

On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were [[2000 Ramallah lynching|lynched in Ramallah]].

Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.

Although Ramallah and its immediate region, now known as [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Area A]], came under collaborative or joint Israeli-[[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) administration in September 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.background-resource.php?resourceID=000921 1995 ''Oslo Interim Agreement''].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Yasser Arafat]] established his West Bank headquarters, the [[Mukataa]], in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the ''de facto'' capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine. It hosts almost all governmental headquarters. In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in [[Gaza City]]. After suicide bombings in [[Haifa]], Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat's building was cut off from the rest of the compound.
[[File:Ramallah Muqata'a 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mukataa]] in 2013.]]

On November 11, 2004 Arafat died at the [[Percy training hospital of the Armies]] near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Throughout 2005, while the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Disengagement Plan]] was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Aurhority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting territorial solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepalestinepapers.com/files/5129.PDF Meeting minutes between Saeb Erekat and David Welch, ''Palestine Papers,'' 16 June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic rehabilitation====
In December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for the 15-seat municipal council for a four-year term. The council elected [[Janet Mikhail]] as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/Displayarticle.asp?section=middleeast&amp;xfile=data/middleeast/2006/january/middleeast_january34.xml |title=Khaleejtimes.com |publisher=Khaleejtimes.com |date=January 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024336/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/Displayarticle.asp?section=middleeast&amp;xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2006%2Fjanuary%2Fmiddleeast_january34.xml |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karin Laub |url=http://www.ocala.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060101/NEWS/201010358/1004/news |title=Ocala.com |publisher=Ocala.com |date=January 1, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munir Hamdan, a member of [[Fatah]] and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, &quot;The president and prime minister have their offices here.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; So do the parliament and all the government ministries&quot;, representing a &quot;collusion&quot; between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; [[Hatem Abdel Kader]], a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that &quot;If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of [[Salam Fayyad]] has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.&quot;&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt;

Many foreign nations have located their diplomatic missions to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, including, {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Korea, South Africa, Norway, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, China, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Russia, Jordan, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name=Toameh&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Article.aspx?id=185283 &quot;'Palestine's new bride'&quot;], Khaled Abu Toameh, ''Jerusalem Post,'' 20 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, king [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/jordan/8904168/Jordans-King-Abdullah-visits-West-Bank-for-first-time-in-decade.html|title=Jordan's King Abdullah visits West Bank for first time in decade|author=|date=|work=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
This area enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah's rainfall is about {{convert|615|mm|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/site/512/default.aspx?tabID=512&amp;lang=en&amp;ItemID=738&amp;mid=3171&amp;wversion=Staging|title=Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics – State of Palestine|author=|date=|work=Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and minimum rainfall is {{convert|307|mm|0|abbr=on}} and maximum rainfall is {{convert|1591|mm|0|abbr=on}}.

The [[Köppen climate classification]] places Ramallah in the [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Csa]] category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.

==Economy==
Ramallah has been described as the seat of power of the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] and serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah's economy greatly since the end of the [[Second Intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/interviews/2009/0114_west_bank_gaza_dhillon.aspx |title=West Bank and Gaza Economy: Before and After the Crisis – Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=January 14, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603050907/http://www.brookings.edu/interviews/2009/0114_west_bank_gaza_dhillon.aspx |archivedate=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ramallah construction boom is one of the most obvious signs of [[West Bank]] economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67129P20100802 | work=Reuters | title=Ramallah building boom symbolizes West Bank growth | date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and &quot;five-star&quot; hotels were erected, particularly in the [[Al-Masyoun]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; In 2010, &quot;more than one hundred&quot; Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from [[East Jerusalem]], because &quot;Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; One local boasted to a journalist that &quot;Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.&quot;&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; This boast was seconded by ''[[The New York Times]]'' which, in 2010, called Ramallah the &quot;de facto capital of the West Bank.&lt;ref name=Loungo&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/travel/06next-1.html Michael T.

The [[Orthodox Church of Ramallah]], an [[Orthodox Christian]] [[convent]], [[Melkite Catholic Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran]] Church, Arab [[Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East|Episcopal]] ([[Anglican]]) Church, Ramallah Local Church ([[Evangelical]]\[[Born again (Christianity)|Born Again]]) and Ramallah [[Baptist]] Church all operate schools in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;RamMuniRel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramallah.ps/etemplate.aspx?id=3 |title=Religion in Ramallah City |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |publisher=Ramallah Municipality |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319232359/http://www.ramallah.ps/etemplate.aspx?id=3 |archivedate=March 19, 2008 }} Information in text is gathered by several links in the &quot;Religion in Ramallah&quot; page.&lt;/ref&gt; A large new church has been built on top of one of the highest hills of Ramallah, belonging to the [[Coptic Orthodox]] Church. A small group of [[Jehovah Witnesses]] are present in the area as well and others.

During the annual &quot;Saturday of Light&quot; religious festival (which occurs on the Saturday between Good Friday and Easter Sunday to commemorate the light that tradition holds shone from the tomb of Jesus), the scouts hold a parade through the city streets to receive the flame from Jerusalem. (The flame is ignited in Jerusalem's [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and is passed on through candles and lanterns to regional churches.) A variety of mosques and churches of different denominations dot the landscape.

==Culture==
[[File:Mausoleo Arafat (Muqata, Ramallah) 01.JPG|thumb|Arafat Mausoleum]]
Ramallah is generally considered the most affluent and cultural, as well as the most liberal, of all Palestinian cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,1391186,00.html Emails from the edge] [[The Observer]], January 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10704035 Hamas says it will use Islamic law as guide] [[NBC News]], January 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and is home to a number of popular Palestinian activists, poets, artists, and [[music of Palestine|musicians]]. It boasts a lively nightlife, with many restaurants including the [[Stars and Bucks Cafe]], a branch of the [[Tche Tche]] Cafe and the [[Orjuwan|Orjuwan Lounge]], described in 2010 as two among the &quot;dozens of fancy restaurants, bars and discotheques that have cropped up in Ramallah in the last three years&quot;.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt;

One hallmark of Ramallah is Rukab's Ice Cream, which is based on the resin of chewing gum and thus has a distinctive taste. Another is the First Ramallah Group, a boy- and girl-scout club that also holds a number of traditional dance ([[Dabka]]) performances and is also home to men's and women's basketball teams that compete regionally. International music and dance troupes occasionally make a stop in Ramallah, and the renowned Argentinian-Israeli pianist [[Daniel Barenboim]] performs there often. The [[Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center]], founded in 1996, is a popular venue for such events. The [[Al-Kasaba Theatre]] is a venue for plays and movies. In 2004, the state-of-the art Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalemites.org/jerusalem/cultural_dimensions/71.htm Jerusalemites.org], cultural dimenstions {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222185339/http://www.jerusalemites.org/jerusalem/cultural_dimensions/71.htm |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.

===Ramallah folklore===
Ramallah, like most Palestinian areas, has a rich folklore of song and dance. Songs accompanied people in every occasion whether it was the harvest season, roofing a house, traveling, coming back from travel, engagement, wedding, or even death. Most of the songs were sung by the women with the exception of Zaffeh and Mal'ab which are sung by the men at wedding celebrations. Palestinian educator Bahia Khalil's book &quot;Ramallah Folklore Songs and Traditions&quot; documents to a great extent this oral tradition inherited from one generation to another. The second edition of the book was published in 2002 by the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine, an organization for Palestinian-Americans from the Ramallah region living in the United States.

Foreign travelers to Palestine in late 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the Palestinian people, and particularly among the fellaheen or village women. Until the 1940s, a woman's economic status, whether married or single, and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most Palestinian women by the type of cloth, colors, cut, and embroidery motifs, or lack thereof, used for the robe-like dress or &quot;thoub&quot; in Arabic

===Palestinian costume===
{{Main|Palestinian costumes}}
Though experts in the field trace the origins of Palestinian costumes to ancient times, there are no surviving clothing [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from this early period against which the modern items might be definitively compared. Influences from the various [[empire]]s to have ruled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Byzantine empire]], and [[Ayyubids]], among [[History of Palestine|others]], have been documented by scholars largely based on the depictions in art and descriptions in literature of costumes produced during these times.

Hanan Munayyer, collector and researcher of Palestinian clothing, sees examples of proto-Palestinian attire in artifacts from the Canaanite period (1500 BCE) such as Egyptian paintings depicting [[Canaanites]] in A-shaped garments.&lt;ref name=Twair&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat McDonnell Twair|date=October 2006|title=Sovereign Threads|publisher=Palestine Heritage Foundation|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Newsletter_December_2006.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munayyer says that from 1200 BC to 1940 AD, all Palestinian dresses were cut from natural fabrics in a similar A-line shape with triangular sleeves.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt; This shape is known to [[archaeology|archaeologists]] as the &quot;Syrian tunic&quot; and appears in artifacts such as an ivory engraving from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] dating to 1200 BC.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneal&gt;{{cite web|author=Denise O'Neal|date=September–October 2005|title=Threads of Tradition:An Exhibition of Palestinian Folk Dress at Antiochian Village|publisher=Palestine Heritage Association|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Threads%20of%20Tradition_Antiochian%20Museum.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the [[fabric]], colours, [[Cut (clothing)|cut]], and [[embroidery]] motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.&lt;ref name=Grutz&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm|author=Jane Waldron Grutz|date=January–February 1991|title=Woven Legacy, Woven Language|magazine=Saudi Aramco World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century, villages in Palestine remained isolated. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Newsletter_July_2005.htm |title=Heritage Newsletter of the Palestinian Heritage Foundation Volume 6 |publisher=Palestineheritage.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramallah women were famous for their distinctive dress of white [[linen]] fabric embroidered with red silk thread. The headdress or ''smadeh'' worn in Ramallah was common throughout northern Palestine: a small roundish cap, padded and stiffened, with gold and silver coins set in a fringe with a long veil pinned to the back, sometimes of silk and sometimes embroidered.
