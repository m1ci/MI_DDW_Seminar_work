'''Sansha''' is a [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Hainan]] province of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). It is located on [[Woody Island (South China Sea)|Woody Island]] and administers (actually or nominally) several island groups and undersea atolls in the [[South China Sea]] including the [[Spratly Islands]], the [[Paracel Islands]], [[Macclesfield Bank]], [[Scarborough Shoal]], and a number of other ungrouped maritime features.&lt;ref name=&quot;SanshaRectified&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.sina.com/china/2012/0621/479131.html |title= China sets up Sansha City to administer South China Sea islands |publisher= [[Sina Corp|Sina]] |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire territory is disputed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/08/travel/china-island-tourism/ | title = China to open disputed islands to tourism | author = Hiufu Wong, CNN | date =  | accessdate = 18 July 2015 | publisher = CNN | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2178656/China-celebrates-birthday-Sansha-new-city-heart-disputed-South-China-Sea-course-neighbours-werent-invited.html | title = China throws 'birthday party' for new city at the heart of disputed South China Sea (of course, the neighbours weren't invited) | author =  | date =  | accessdate = 18 July 2015 | publisher = Mail Online | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/24/sansha-china_n_1697523.html | title = China Declares New 'City' On Tiny, Remote Island | author =  | date =  | accessdate = 18 July 2015 | publisher = The Huffington Post | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PRC's ''[[de facto]]'' control over the area varies.

Foreign reaction to the declaration was not positive. The United States Department of State called the change in the administrative status of the territory &quot;unilateral&quot;, and the move has received criticism from nations engaged in the South China Sea dispute, particularly the Philippines and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;

==Recent history==
[[File:永兴岛 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Yongxing Town on Woody Island]]
''Also see [[Woody Island (South China Sea)|History of Woody island]]''

In March 1953, as talks were proceeding with the French on the handing over of Hainan and territories south of [[Guangdong]] to the [[People's Republic of China]], the Chinese [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] authorized the  establishment of a separate &quot;[[Guangdong Province]] Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority&quot; as a [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level administrative division]] on Woody Island (Yongxing Dao). However, the island continued to support a threadbare population of fisherfolk at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beijing Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=China's Jurisdiction over the South China Sea |url= http://www.bjreview.com.cn/Cover_Stories_Series_2012/2012-07/03/content_464506.htm |publisher=Beijing Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1959, during China's [[Cultural Revolution]], when [[Revolutionary committee (China)|Revolutionary Committee]]s were being set up across the country, this authority was upgraded to the &quot;Guangdong Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Revolutionary Committee&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beijing Review&quot;/&gt; In October 1984, the administration of Sansha consisting of Yong xing dao (Woody island) and other islands in the South China sea was transferred to [[Hainan]]. This coincided with the establishment of Hainan as a separate administrative region. In September 1988,the authority's name was officially changed to the &quot;Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority&quot;. On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever &quot;Residents' and Fishermen's Congress&quot; was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages. The Neighborhood Committee began work on Woody Island the following day with an office at the Border Guards of the Paracels' Police Station. These were the first ever actual subdivisions created within the county-level authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beijing Review&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--
Before the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]]'s (UNCLOS III) addendums to the Law of the Sea, the Central government had always maintained a claim to nearly 3.5 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.35 million sq. mi.) in maritime area of the South China Sea {{fact|date=August 2012}}, which equated to roughly one-third of China's total land area. The Central government claimed this as part of China's sovereign [[territorial waters]], commonly known as &quot;China's blue territories&quot;. It was delineated on maps by the 9 or 10 dashed lines. Although many Chinese maps published after UNCLOS III still retain these dashed lines, they have no legal value and are used solely as a reference line to denote that &quot;all features (islands, reefs, banks, shoals, cays, sands) located within the dashed lines are sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China&quot;. UNCLOS III, which has been ratified by China, went into force on the 16 November 1994. New [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] and the Paracels were released on the 15 May 1996. The addendum for the EEZ's extension via [[Continental shelf#Economic significance|Continental Shelves (in the legal sense)]] was also handed to the [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS). Coupled with officially published laws of the past, China's new [[internal waters]] and [[territorial waters]], namely, China's &quot;blue territories&quot;, could thus be calculated to an area of approximately {{convert|31000|km2|abbr=on}}.
--&gt;

The prospect of the establishment of a &quot;city&quot; on Woody Island was first publicized on 19 November 2007 in a report by [[Mingpao]], a Hong Kong-based newspaper, through a telephone interview with a Mr. Zhang of the Propaganda Department of [[Wenchang]], Hainan. This report claimed that a [[county-level city]] was to be established by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|PRC State Council]] in November 2007 to administer three disputed [[archipelago]]s in the South China Sea:&lt;ref name=&quot;Stratfor&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stratfor.com/products/premium/read_article.php?id=299411&amp;selected=Analyses |title=Vietnam, China: The Dispute over Significant Waterways |work=Free Intelligence Reports |publisher=[[Stratfor]] |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Paracel Islands, Macclesfield Bank (Zhongsha Islands) and the Spratly Islands. This was to replace the county-level &quot;Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority&quot;.  The city of Wenchang would provide{{vague|date=October 2014}} supplies and logistics to the to-be-established city.

On 23 July 2012 the PRC [[Central Military Commission]] announced it had authorized the [[People's Liberation Army]] Guangzhou Military Command to form a &quot;garrison command&quot; in Sansha City. The troops would be responsible for managing the city's national defence mobilisation, military reserve, and carrying out military operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18949941 ''China Approves Military Garrison''], 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2012, the PRC officially established the city of Sansha in Yongxing Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuaen0&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-07/24/c_131734893.htm |title=China establishes Sansha City |date=24 July 2012 |publisher=Xinhua |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
Sansha is governed by a municipal congress of 60 delegates directly elected, with a standing committee of 15 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sansha government |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-07/17/c_131721193.htm |date= 17 July 2012 |publisher=Xinhua Net |accessdate=8 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further subdivided into 3 [[District of the People's Republic of China|islands-districts]] at county-level, 3 [[Town (China)|towns/management committees]] at the township-level, and further into 11 [[Residential community|residential communities]] at village-level, based on the island groups:

Less than 1000 people live in Sansha city (which is located on Woody Island, a small island in the Paracels). They tend to practice fishing, and selling products to the occasional cruise ship (''MV Qionghai 3'' and ''MV Sansha 1'') whose tourists visit the island. In November 2016, the Hainan government started to allow large companies to register themselves in Sansha, by providing extensive [[Tax haven|tax benefits]] to them. This resulted in 157 large national and multinational companies registering themselves in Sansha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China's Sansha island draws world's largest companies |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-11/24/c_135855349.htm |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Xinhua |date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a government school and a public library were opened in the island, primarily for children of the islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China's southernmost school opens inc |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-09/02/c_135654567.htm |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Xinhua |date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First library opened in Sansha in South China Sea |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-04/21/c_135300808.htm |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Xinhua |date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a [[Desalination|desalinating plant]] was established to provide drinking water to the island's residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New desalinator put into use in China's Sansha |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-10/02/c_135729180.htm |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Xinhua |date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airports are built on several islands in Sansha City, including Yongxing Island ([[Woody Island (South China Sea)|woody island]]), Meiji Island, [[Yongshu Island]] and Zhubi Island, all of which are capable for planes sizing up to 4E standards, theoretically capable of landing [[Boeing 777]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as diversion airports. In practice, only Yongxing Island see scheduled commercial services, onboard [[Boeing 737]] operated by [[Hainan Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/hu7417|title=Live Flight Tracker - Real-Time Flight Tracker Map|last=Flightradar24|website=Flightradar24|language=en|access-date=2019-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage of a greening project for Sansha was announced on 30 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-07/30/c_133520232.htm |title= China Focus: South China islands see green transformation |date= 30 July 2014 |accessdate= 13 September 2014 |work= news.xinhuanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It states: &quot;According to the investment plan, 18 million yuan (about 2.92 million U.S. dollars) will be used to build desalination systems and grow trees on Xishazhou Island ([[West Sand]] - NW Crescent Group) in the hope of turning the island into a new oasis.&quot;  The article makes references to the greening of:
*Ganquan Island ([[Robert Island (Paracel Islands)|Robert Island]]) - W Crescent Group between Antelope Reef and Pattle Island, where an environmental protection station was set up in February 2014
*Jinqin (Drummond Island) - E Crescent Group
*Lingyangjiao (Antelope Reef) - W Crescent Group between [[Money Island, Paracel Islands|Money]] and [[Robert Island (Paracel Islands)|Robert]] Islands
*Xishazhou Island ([[West Sand]]) - NW Crescent Group
*[[Yagong Island]] - NE Crescent Group, between Tree Island and Observation Bank
*Yinyu (Observation Bank / Silver Islet) - NE Crescent Group
*Yongxing Island ([[Woody Island (South China Sea)|Woody Island]]) - Centre of Amphitrite group
*Zhaoshu ([[Tree Island, South China Sea|Tree Island]]) - N Crescent Group
It also mentions substantial infrastructure upgrades to Woody Island, including waste-water treatment, garbage aggregation and treatment, desalination (1 million litres/day) and upgrades to photovoltaic equipment.

==Controversy and protests==
Because Sansha's jurisdiction comprises island groups that several nations besides the PRC claim as their own, the &quot;city&quot; is considered by some as controversial.

In 2007, the Foreign Ministry of [[Vietnam]] protested against the city's proposed establishment, which had been recently &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rfa.org/vietnamese/in_depth/rare-vn-demo-over-sea-dispute-with-cn-06052011093311.html | title = Hà Nội và Sài Gòn biểu tình chống Trung Quốc | author =  | date =  | accessdate = 18 July 2015 | publisher = [[Đài Á Châu Tự do]] | language = vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved by the PRC's State Council, as Vietnam claims two of the three island groups that comprise Sansha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns071204135539 | title=Vietnam objects to China's establishment of San Sha city on the Hainan Island |work= Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokesman Mr. Le Dzung answers questions on 3rd December 2007 | publisher=Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs | date=3 December 2007 | accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later followed by student demonstrations at the Chinese embassy in [[Hanoi]], and at a consulate in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IL20Ad01.html | title=China, Vietnam churn diplomatic waters | work=Asia Times Online | date=20 December 2007 | accessdate=7 August 2012 | author=Symon, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days prior to the official establishment of the city in late July 2012,&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuaen0&quot; /&gt; Vietnam again stated its opposition and was joined in its protests by the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;

Western reaction to the 2012 declaration of the Chinese government elevating the administrative status of Sansha was not positive. The [[United States Department of State]] called the change in the administrative status of the territory &quot;[[Unilateralism|unilateral]]&quot;, and the move has received criticism from nations engaged in the [[South China Sea dispute]], particularly the [[Philippines]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;

Various factions of the Muslim [[Moro people]] are [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|waging a war for independence against the Philippines]]. The website of the separatist [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) of [[Nur Misuari]] declared its support for China against the Philippines in the South China Sea dispute, calling both China and the Moro people as victims of Philippine colonialism, and noting China's history of friendly relations with the Moros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mnlfnet.com/Articles/BYC_08Oct2012_Historical%20&amp;%20Human%20Wrong%20of%20Phil%20Colonialism.htm |title=HISTORICAL AND &quot;HUMAN WRONG&quot; OF PHILIPPINE COLONIALISM: HOW NOT TO RESPECT HISTORIC-HUMAN RIGHTS OF BANGSAMORO AND CHINA?| author= RRayhanR |date= 8 October 2012|website=mnlfnet.com |publisher= Moro National Liberation Front (Misuari faction) |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MNLF website also denounced America's assistance to the Philippines in their colonization of the Moro people in addition to denouncing the Philippines claims to the islands disputed with China, and denouncing America for siding with the Philippines in the dispute, noting that in 1988 [[Johnson South Reef Skirmish|China &quot;punished&quot; Vietnam]] for attempting to set up a military presence on the disputed islands, and noting that the Moros and China maintained peaceful relations, while on the other hand the Moros had to resist other colonial powers, having to [[Spanish–Moro conflict|fight the Spanish]], [[Moro rebellion|fight the Americans]], and [[Philippine resistance against Japan#Moro resistance on Mindanao and Sulu|fight the Japanese]], in addition to fighting the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mnlfnet.com/Articles/Editorial_11August2012_Impact%20of%20Possible%20China-Phil%20War%20Within%20Filipino-Moro%20War%20in%20Mindanao.htm |title=IMPACT OF POSSIBLE CHINA-PHILIPPINES WAR WITHIN FILIPINO-MORO WAR IN MINDANAO | author= RRayhanR |date= 11 August 2012|website=mnlfnet.com |publisher= Moro National Liberation Front (Misuari faction) |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Champa historically had a large presence in the South China Sea. The Vietnamese broke Champa's power in [[Cham–Vietnamese War (1471)|an invasion of Champa in 1471]], and then finally conquered the last remnants of the Cham people in an invasion in 1832. A Cham named Katip Suma who received Islamic education in Kelantan declared a [[Jihad]] against the Vietnamese, and fighting continued until the Vietnamese crushed the remnants of the resistance in 1835. The Cham organization Front de Libération du Champa was part of the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races]], which waged war against the Vietnamese for independence in the [[Vietnam War]] along with the [[Degar people|Montagnard]] and [[Khmer Krom]] minorities. The last remaining FULRO insurgents surrendered to the United Nations in 1992. Vietnam has settled over a million ethnic Vietnamese on Montagnard lands in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. The Montagnard staged a massive protest against the Vietnamese in 2001, which led to the Vietnamese to forcefully crush the uprising and seal the entire area off to foreigners.

The Vietnamese government fears that evidence of [[Champa]]'s influence over the disputed area in the South China Sea would bring attention to human rights violations and killings of ethnic minorities in Vietnam such as in the 2001 and 2004 uprisings, and lead to the issue of Cham autonomy being brought into the dispute, since the Vietnamese conquered the Hindu and Muslim [[Cham people]] in a war in 1832, and the Vietnamese continue to destroy evidence of Cham culture and artifacts left behind, plundering or building on top of Cham temples, building farms over them, banning Cham religious practices, and omitting references to the destroyed Cham capital of Song Luy in the 1832 invasion in history books and tourist guides. The situation of Cham compared to ethnic Vietnamese is substandard, lacking water and electricity and living in houses made out of mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bray |first=Adam |last2= |first2= |date= June 16, 2014 |title= The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/ |archiveurl=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/169-the-cham-descendants-of-ancient-rulers-of-south-china-sea-watch-maritime-dispute-from-sidelines|archivedate=2014|journal= National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region. Both Hindu and Muslim Chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thành Tín and Phươc Nhơn villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/news-tin-t-c/100-mission-to-vietnam-advocacy-day |title=Mission to Vietnam Advocacy Day (Vietnamese-American Meet up 2013) in the U.S. Capitol.

==Transport==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
Before the 1970s, the only means of transport to and from the islands was by fishing boat, and even then, only Woody Island was accessible.  The rest of the Paracels, the Zhongsha Islands and the Spratlys were only accessible to military personnel. The situation was improved in 1977 with the construction of a freighter given approval by then Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Having a tonnage of 2160 tonnes and a maximum load of 200 passengers, the &quot;Qiongsha 1&quot; (literally &quot;Hainan-South China Sea Islands 1&quot;) freighter carried supplies and people between Woody Island and Hainan Island. In 1997, &quot;Qiongsha 1&quot; was destroyed in a typhoon while en route to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] Province for routine maintenance and upkeep. A smaller &quot;Qiongsha 2&quot; freighter of 1410 tonnes and a maximum load of 100 passengers was commissioned that same year. It operated for 10 years, and was decommissioned in January 2007.

Since 2008, the &quot;lifeboat&quot; of the islands is the &quot;Qiongsha 3&quot; freighter (Tonnage: 2500 tonnes; Load: 200 passengers; Payload: 750 tonnes in cargo; Length: 84 metres; Width: 13.8 metres). This is essentially the only means of transportation to and from the islands for non-military personnel (mostly fishermen and researchers). Its maiden voyage was on 10 February 2007, and it has been sailing regularly between [[Wenchang]]'s Qinglan Port on southeastern Hainan Island and Woody Island in the Paracels roughly every 20 days. A normal trip takes 13 to 15 hours, navigating between dangerous reefs and banks, through a distance of {{convert|186|nmi|km}}. --&gt;
