==Archaeology==
[[File:Bronze flag, Shadad Kerman, Iran.JPG|thumb|Ancient bronze [[flag]] found at Shahdad, c. 2400 BC]]

Shahdad was a major Bronze Age centre discovered in 1968. Around 1970, Ali Hakemi of Archaeological Institute of Iran investigated the site. He conducted excavations for seven seasons.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;By the early third millennium B.C., Shahdad began to grow quickly as international trade with Mesopotamia expanded. Tomb excavations revealed spectacular artifacts amid stone blocks once painted in vibrant colors. These include several extraordinary, nearly life-size clay statues placed with the dead. The city's artisans worked lapis lazuli, silver, lead, turquoise, and other materials imported from as far away as eastern Afghanistan, as well as shells from the distant Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. Evidence shows that ancient Shahdad had a large metalworking industry by this time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lawler, [http://archive.archaeology.org/1111/features/dasht-e_lut_iran_shahr-i-sokta-shahad_tepe_yaha.html The World in Between] Volume 64 Number 6, November/December 2011 archaeology.org&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shahdad shares many parallels with [[Shahr-i-Sokhta]]. Many other ancient settlements are found in what is now empty desert. According to Iranian archaeologist Hassan Fazeli Nashli, some 900 Bronze Age sites have been documented in the [[Sistan Basin]] between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

North of town, a [[Jiroft Civilization]] village is said to have existed around 6,000 BC. The legendary [[Aratta]] of the Sumerian sources may have been located in this area.

The oldest metal flag in human history was found in this city.
