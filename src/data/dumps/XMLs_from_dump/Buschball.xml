'''Buschball''' is a new sport, a combination of [[Football (soccer)|football]] and [[crossgolf]]. Buschball can be played by virtually anyone. It was invented in Germany.

== Rules and Aim of the Game ==
The aim of the game is to hit the pole with as little shots as possible. The pole is a [[Flagpole (structure)#Flagpoles|flag pole]]. Both the pole as well as the flag are part of the target.
First the order of the players is drawn. The first player sets the pole for the first round, the second player begins the round by trying to hit the pole with as few kicks as possible. Once everyone has had a turn the second player places the pole and the third player starts the round etc. 
Every player has a maximum of nine attempts to hit the pole. If after these nine attempts he fails to hit the pole ten points are recorded for that particular player and it is the following player’s turn. At the end of the round the player with the fewest kicks is awarded a best round.
The first set is completed once everyone has had a turn to place the pole. The players can decide how many sets they wish to play. The winner is the person who at the end of the last set has the fewest kicks. In the case of a draw the number of best rounds decides.&lt;br /&gt;
Note: While playing, no-one is allowed to touch the ball while it is still moving. Before a shot, any loose object behind the ball (sticks, stones, etc.) can be removed to ensure safety. Any object in front of the ball may not be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buschball.eu/rules.html Official Buschball rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The oldest known version of Buschball was played in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abendblatt.de/sport/sportplatz-hamburg/article1044478/Wiedergeburt-des-Buschballs.html Newspaper article about the Buschball history]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of players for a standard game of football Andreas Oligmüller and his friends decided to shoot at trees and [[road signs]]. After a while that became too easy so they decided to aim at trees hidden behind bushes. The first variant of the game was born.&lt;br /&gt;
Over time the sport was forgotten until approximately 30 years later Johannes Schmitt was told about the sport. Together with Martin Sowa he refined the concept for the game. Due to the increasing danger of shooting at road signs they decided to create a mobile target.&lt;br /&gt;
They constructed a flag pole, the so-called “Pole”. This is used as a target in the modern version of the game. Since 2009 Buschball-Poles are produced by [[B+D allzweck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allzweck.de Homepage B+D allzweck]&lt;/ref&gt; They produce the [[corner flag]]s which have been used at every major football tournament for the last 30 years.

== Players and Clubs ==
The number of players and clubs is constantly growing. In 2008, 35 people played buschball and in 2009 the sport had managed to attract 150 players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buschball.de/spieler.html List of buschball players]&lt;/ref&gt; During the year of inception there were only German Buschball players. In 2009 however, there were Croatians, Americans and Italians playing Buschball. At the beginning of the year 2010 the first matches in [[South Africa]] were played.&lt;br /&gt; 
The first Buschball Club called '''1. Buschball Verein Rheinhausen '08 e.V.''' was founded in June 2008 in [[Rheinhausen|Duisburg-Rheinhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbv-rheinhausen.de Homepage BBV Rheinhausen '08]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a second club was founded in [[Hamburg|Hamburg (Germany)]] called '''1. Hamburg Poppenbütteler Buschball Club '09 e.V.'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hpbc09.de/ |title=Homepage HPBC '09 |access-date=2019-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227220857/http://www.hpbc09.de/ |archive-date=2011-02-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
