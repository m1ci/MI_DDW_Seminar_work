'''Slopestyle''' is a [[winter sport]] in which athletes [[skiing|ski]] or [[snowboard]] down a course including a variety of obstacles including rails, jumps and other [[terrain park]] features. Points are scored for amplitude, originality and quality of tricks. The discipline has its roots in action sports like [[skateboarding]] and [[BMX]] and has very successfully crossed over into the snow sports worlds of skiing and snowboarding.&lt;ref name=cfsa&gt;{{cite web|title=Slopestyle|url=http://freestyleski.com//about/freestyle-101/disciplines/|publisher=Canadian Freestyle Ski Association|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skiers use [[Twin-tip ski|Twin-tip skis]] for their symmetry since they often go large portions of the course backward (referred to as &quot;switch&quot;) and for their balanced weight so don't destabilize spins. Slopestyle tricks fall mainly into four categories: spins, [[Grind_(sport)|grinds]], grabs and [[Flip (acrobatic)|flip]]s, and most tricks done in competition are a combination of these.

Slopestyle is one of the [[Freestyle_skiing|freestyle]] disciplines, along with [[Mogul skiing|moguls]], [[Freestyle_skiing#Aerial_skiing|aerials]], [[Ski Cross|cross]], [[Big air]] and [[half-pipe]].

==History==
Slopestyle became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic event]], in both skiing and snowboarding forms, at the [[2014 Winter Games]] in [[Sochi, Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/other_news/1216135778.html |title=Slopestyle Approved For Sochi 2014 |publisher=GamesBids.com |accessdate=2011-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904041143/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/other_news/1216135778.html |archivedate=2011-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first Olympic champions in Slopestyle Skiing were American [[Joss Christensen]] for the men and Canadian [[Dara Howell]] for the women. The first Olympic champions for Snowboarding Slopestyle were both Americans, [[Sage Kotsenburg]] for the men and [[Jamie Anderson (snowboarder)|Jamie Anderson]] for the women.

==Competition==
In competition, athletes compete for points awarded by judges on a structured basis. The scoring criteria vary from one organization to another and from each event to the next, but in general athletes are judged on these criteria:&lt;ref name=cfsa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mpora.com/snowboarding/slopestyle-event-guide#AgV12d5VLXqxDKMU.97|title=What Is Slopestyle? {{!}} Winter Olympic Guide For Pyeongchang 2018|work=Mpora|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Amplitude''': Height of jumps, also called air. Bigger tricks score higher.
* '''Difficulty''': [[Degree of difficulty]] of the tricks.
* '''Execution''': How well the athletes perform their tricks. For example tight rotation, clean grabs, and smooth landing.
* '''Variety''': The difference of the tricks within the run. Doing the same trick of all the jumps will not score highly even if it is a very difficult trick. 
* '''Progression''': How the trick selection progresses the sport, for example brand new tricks will score high because they push the sport forward.
* '''Combinations or flow''': The way the athletes string the tricks together. Having to slow down or otherwise reset after a trick will lose points. 
* '''Overall''': The whole package, including the athlete’s personal style.

A feature that is somewhat unique to slopestyle and similar events is that even though it's a judged sport, scores cannot be compared between events: &quot;A run that scores 65 at one event may score 75 at another event. The score is just a tool to organize the rankings and may vary based on the range and anchor score set for the day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://usskiandsnowboard.org/sites/default/files/files-resources/files/2017-10/2018_fre_comp_guide.pdf 2018 US Ski and Snowboard Freestyle Competition Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
