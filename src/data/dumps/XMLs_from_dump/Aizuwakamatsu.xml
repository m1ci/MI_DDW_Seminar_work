{{Nihongo| '''Aizuwakamatsu'''|会津若松市|Aizuwakamatsu-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Fukushima Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2018|11|01}}, the city had an estimated population of 120,733 in 49,942 households,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.city.aizuwakamatsu.fukushima.jp Aizuwakamatsu city official statistics]{{in lang|ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[population density]] of 320 persons per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total area of the city was  {{convert|382.97|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==History==
The area of present-day Aizuwakamatsu was part of ancient [[Mutsu Province]], and was settled from prehistoric times. The [[Aizu-Otsuka Kofun]] within the city borders dates from the 4th century AD, and is an [[Important Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Cultural Property]].

According to legend, in 88 BCE, [[Emperor Sujin]] sent two generals; Ohiko and Takenukawa-wake to [[Tōhoku region|Tohoku]] for the purpose of establishing peace after the quashing of a rebellion in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=10|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the late 12th century, Aizuwakamatsu was mainly a market town and a base for regional warlords. Starting in 1192, Aizuwakamatsu became part of the regions that were controlled by the [[Kamakura shogunate|Kamakura Shogunate]] after [[Minamoto no Yoritomo|Minamoto Yoritomo]] established the shogunate which governed much of Japan. Soon after taking power, Yoritomo granted a samurai named Suwara Yoshitsura (from the Miura clan) all of Aizu. A descendant of Suwara, Ashina Morinori, began construction of the first castle in the city in 1384.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

During the [[Sengoku period]] the final lord of Aizu, Ashina Moritaka, died in 1583 and soon the Ashina clan lost power. After the Satake clan took control of the Ashina's castle, they placed a twelve-year-old member of their clan who was renamed Ashina Morishige and proclaimed lord of Aizu. The Ashina family regained control of Aizu for a brief time in 1589 with the help of Date Masamune. However, Masamune took over the domain for himself soon after. He surrendered in 1590 to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Toyotomi gave Aizu to one of his allies, Gamo Ujisato who then began construction in 1592 of a new castle at the site. It was during this time that the town was renamed Wakamatsu (young pine).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

During the [[Edo period]], Aizu was controlled briefly by [[Uesugi Kagekatsu]] in 1600 after the death of Gamo Ujisato in 1596. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Tokugawa Ieyusu]] accused Uesugi of gathering troops in Aizu and that he'll use it to seize more power. Ieyusu ordered Date Masmune and his allies to go against Uesugi. After the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Aizu was given to Ujisato's descendants. Through inheritance, Aizu was passed to Hoshina Masayuki (a brother of the third Tokugawa shogun) in 1643. The Edo period saw the economic and cultural growth of Aizu.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[Aizu Domain]] was the location of the [[Battle of Aizu]], one of the largest conflicts of the [[Boshin War]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Wakamatsu Town was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It became Wakamatsu City in 1899. The name was changed to Aizuwakamatsu in 1955.
