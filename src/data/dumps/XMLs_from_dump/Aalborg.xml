The twin city [[Nørresundby]] is {{convert|600|m|ft}} across the [[Limfjord]]. With a population of 215,312 ({{as of|2019|lc=on}}), the [[Municipality of Aalborg]] is the third most populous in the country after [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]] and [[Aarhus Municipality|Aarhus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pop1&quot; /&gt; By road Aalborg is {{convert|64|km}} southwest of [[Frederikshavn]], and {{convert|118|km}} north of [[Aarhus]]. The distance to [[Copenhagen]] is {{convert|412|km}} if travelling by road and not using ferries.

The earliest settlements date to around AD&amp;nbsp;700. Aalborg's position at the narrowest point on the [[Limfjord]] made it an important harbour during the [[Middle Ages]], and later a large industrial centre. Architecturally, the city is known for its half-timbered mansions built by its prosperous merchants. [[Budolfi Church]], now a cathedral, dates from the end of the 14th century and [[Aalborghus|Aalborghus Castle]], a royal residence, was built in 1550. Today, Aalborg is a city in transition from a [[working-class]] industrial area to a [[knowledge-based]] community. A major exporter of [[Cereal|grain]], [[cement]], and [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], its thriving business interests include [[Siemens Wind Power]], [[Alfa Laval|Aalborg Industries]], and [[Aalborg Portland]]. These companies have become global producers of [[wind turbine]] rotors, marine boilers and cement.

With its theatres, [[Aalborg Symphony Orchestra|symphony orchestra]], opera company, [[Aalborg Hall|performance venues]], and museums such as [[Aalborg Historical Museum]] and the [[KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art Aalborg|Aalborg Museum of Modern Art]], Aalborg is an important cultural hub. The [[Aalborg Carnival]], held at the end of May, is one of the largest festivals in Scandinavia, attracting some 100,000 people annually. The major university is the [[Aalborg University|University of Aalborg]], founded in 1974, which has more than 20,000 students (as of 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aau.dk/om-aau/aau-i-tal/ AAU i tal]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University College of Northern Denmark]] is one of seven new regional organisations while the [[Royal School of Library and Information Science]] (RSLIS) provides higher education in library and information science. [[Trænregimentet]], the Danish regiment for army supply and emergency medical personnel, is also in Aalborg. [[Aalborg Hospital|Aalborg University Hospital]], the largest in the north of Jutland, was founded in 1881.

The football club [[Aalborg Boldspilklub|Aalborg BK]], established in 1885 and based at [[Nordjyske Arena]], won the Danish Superliga in the [[Danish Superliga 1994–95|1994–95 season]], the [[Danish Superliga 1998–99|1998–99 season]], the [[Danish Superliga 2007–08|2007–08 season]] and the [[2013–14 Danish Superliga|2013–14 season]]. Other sports associations include the icehockey club [[Aalborg Pirates]], the men's handball team [[Aalborg Håndbold]], the rugby club [[Aalborg RK]], and Aalborg Cricket Club. [[Aalborg Railway Station]], on [[John F. Kennedys Plads]] has connected the city to [[Randers]] and the south since 1869. [[Aalborg Airport]] is just {{convert|6|km}} northwest of the city centre, and the [[European route E45|E45]], a European route from [[Alta (town)|Alta]], Norway, to [[Gela]], Italy, passes through Aalborg.

The [[European Commission]] has concluded that the citizens of Aalborg are the most satisfied people in Europe with their city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eu-norddanmark.dk/dk/nyheder/aalborg_er_eus_mest_tilfredse_by.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308003643/http://www.eu-norddanmark.dk/dk/nyheder/aalborg_er_eus_mest_tilfredse_by.htm |archivedate=2014-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area around the narrowest point on the Limfjord  attracted settlements as far back as the [[Germanic Iron Age|Iron Age]] leading to a thriving [[Viking]] community until around the year 1000 in what has now become Aalborg. In the [[Middle Ages]], royal trading privileges, a natural harbour and a thriving [[herring]] fishing industry contributed to the town's growth. Despite the difficulties it experienced over the centuries, the city began to prosper once again towards the end of the 19th century when a bridge was built over Limfjord and the railway arrived. Aalborg's initial growth relied on heavy industry but its current development focuses on culture and education.&lt;ref name=au/&gt;

===Beginnings===
[[File:Aalborg - Lindholm Høje 10 ies.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lindholm Høje]]]]
[[File:Hardeknud mynt Alabu.jpg|thumb|Hardeknud coin embossed Alabu (c. 1040), the original name of Aalborg]]
Aalborg traces its history back over a thousand years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the [[Limfjord]]. The sites of what were two settlements and a burial ground can be seen on [[Lindholm Høje]], a hill overlooking the city. These large settlements, one from the 6th-century [[Germanic Iron Age]], the other from the [[Viking Age]] in the 9th to 11th centuries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepsen1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans Lyngby Jepsen|title=Nordjylland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erh0NwAACAAJ|accessdate=20 August 2013|year=1986|publisher=Gyldendal|isbn=978-87-00-80962-8|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord as a result of the traffic between [[Himmerland]] to the south and [[Vendsyssel]] to the north.

The first mention of Aalborg under its original name ''Alabu'' or ''Alabur'' is found on coins from c.&amp;nbsp;1040, the period when [[Harthacnut I of Denmark|King Harthacnut]] (Hardeknud) settled in the area. In c.&amp;nbsp;1075, [[Adam of Bremen]] reported that ''Alaburg'', as he called it in German, was an important harbour for ships sailing to Norway.&lt;ref name=&quot;OlsenMonty2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Søren Olsen|author2=Kasper Monty|title=Danmarks købstæder: 144 købstæder og andre gamle byer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFX8OwAACAAJ|accessdate=20 August 2013|year=2000|publisher=Politiken|isbn=978-87-567-6203-8|pages=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Valdemar's [[Danish Census Book]] from 1231 it was called ''Aleburgh'', possibly meaning &quot;the fort by the stream&quot; as  in [[Old Norse]] ''all'' meant a stream or current and ''bur'' or ''burgh'' a fort or a castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alabur.dk/Om_Alabur.htm|title=Alaburs historie|language=Danish|accessdate=24 August 2013|publisher=Alabur.dk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903144833/http://www.alabur.dk/Om_Alabur.htm|archivedate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Church of Our Lady in Aalborg was originally built in the early 12th century but was demolished during the Reformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUhist&quot;/&gt;  Grey Friar Convent, on the east side of Østerå, was probably built around 1240; it was documented in 1268 when it was a Franciscan Convent of the Order of Friars Minor, but like many other Roman Catholic monasteries and convents was shut down in 1530 as a result of the Reformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUhist&quot;/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:1536 Skipper Clement.jpg|thumb|right|Execution of the rebel Skipper Clement in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], 1536 (engraving by an unknown author, 1574)]]
Aalborg's earliest trading privileges date from 1342, when [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|King Valdemar IV]] received the town as part of his huge [[dowry]] on marrying [[Helvig of Schleswig]]. The privileges were extended by [[Eric of Pomerania]] in 1430 and by [[Christopher of Bavaria]] in 1441. The town prospered, becoming one of the largest communities in Denmark. Its prosperity increased when the merchant- and trade association Guds Legems Laug was established in 1481, facilitating trade with the [[Hanseatic League]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AUhist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/|title=The History of Aalborg|publisher=Aalborg University School of Engineering and Science|accessdate=5 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201210950/http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/|archivedate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
especially from 1516 when [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] granted it a [[monopoly]] in salting Limfjord's herring.{{sfn|Christensen|Mikkelsen|2008|p=58}} The king frequently visited the town, where he held court and stayed in the old [[Aalborghus]]. The herring fishery linked Aalborg to the East coast of England, across the North Sea, both in commercial competition and cultural exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepsen1986&quot;/&gt; During the Middle Ages a number of important institutions were established in Aalborg, including Budolfi Cathedral in the late 14th century and the [[Hospital of the Holy Ghost, Aalborg|Hospital of the Holy Ghost]], a monastery and nunnery founded in 1451 to help those in need.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUhist&quot;/&gt; It was converted into a hospital during the Reformation and is still in use today as a nursing home for the elderly.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUhist&quot;/&gt;

In 1530 a large part of the town was destroyed by fire, and in December 1534 it was stormed and plundered by the king's troops after a peasants' revolt known as the [[Count's Feud]] led by [[Skipper Clement]]. It resulted in the death of up to 2,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUhist&quot;/&gt; The [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]] in 1536 brought about the demolition of the town's two monasteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepsen1986&quot;/&gt; As a result of the Reformation, Aalborg became a [[Lutheran]] bishopric in 1554.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUhist&quot;/&gt;

===17th to 19th centuries===

From the 1550s to the 1640s, as a result of increased foreign trade, Aalborg enjoyed great prosperity, second only to that of Copenhagen. The population grew in parallel with the development of many fine buildings in the city as merchants benefitted from their shipping routes from Norway to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/om_kommunen/byplanlaegning/kulturarv/aalborg-bevar-mig-vel/store-nygade-kvarteret/documents/aalborgs_historie_kort_fortalt.pdf|format=pdf|author1=Stig Bergmann Møller|author2=Bente Springborg|title=Aalborg kort fortalt: Fra 700-tallet til 1600-tallet|language=Danish|accessdate=22 August 2013|publisher=Aalborg Kommune|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201221113/http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/om_kommunen/byplanlaegning/kulturarv/aalborg-bevar-mig-vel/store-nygade-kvarteret/documents/aalborgs_historie_kort_fortalt.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1663, the city suffered yet another serious fire, which destroyed the tower of Budolfi Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aalborgstift.dk/kirker/budolfi/budolfi-kirke-aalborg-domkirke/historie/|author=Niels Clemmensen|title=Budolfi kirke, Aalborg domkirke: Historie|language=Danish|accessdate=23 August 2013|publisher=Alborg Stift|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202111048/http://aalborgstift.dk/kirker/budolfi/budolfi-kirke-aalborg-domkirke/historie/|archivedate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 18th century, Aalborg entered a further period of prosperity. In [[Erik Pontoppidan]]'s ''Danske Atlas'' (Danish Atlas) it was described as &quot;after Copenhagen, the best and most prosperous market town in Denmark&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rikkitikki.dk/index.php?id=186 &quot;Historien om Ellen Marsvins hus&quot;], Rikki Tikki Company. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The population grew from 4,160 in 1769 to 5,579 in 1801. In 1767, the second newspaper ever published in Denmark appeared in the city.&lt;ref name=au/&gt;

After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg lost its important role as the country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also suffered as a result of difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked [[Thy (district)|Thy]] with the rest of Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the [[February flood of 1825|1825 North Sea storm]].&lt;ref name=au&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/|title=The History of Aalborg|accessdate=20 August 2013|publisher=Aalborg University|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201210950/http://www.en.ses.aau.dk/Admission/New+Student+Service/The+History+of+Aalborg/|archivedate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by [[Aarhus]] as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn. In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepsen1986&quot;/&gt; The harbour facilities were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port.&lt;ref name=dka/&gt; Aalborg became the country's main producer of tobacco products and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement.&lt;ref name=pd&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/historisktidsskrift/article/view/33812/65352|author=Peter Dragsbo|title=Henning Bender: Aalborgs industrielle udvikling fra 1735 til 1940, Aalborgs Historie, bd. 4, udg. af Aalborg Kommune 1987, 520 s|language=Danish|accessdate=21 August 2013|publisher= Historisk Tidsskrift, Bind 15. række, 3 (1988) 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.&lt;ref name=au/&gt;

===20th century industrialisation===
Around the beginning of the 20th century, as a result of decisions taken by the municipality, many of the city's half-timbered houses were torn down. They were replaced by hundreds of modern buildings, completely changing the look of the city. Factories with smoking chimneys became ever more prevalent in the outskirts. Among the most important were [[De Danske Spritfabrikker]] (spirits and liquors), De forenede Textilfabrikker (textiles), the [[East Asiatic Company]] (trading), Dansk Eternit (building materials) and [[C.W. Obel]]'s tobacco factory (established in 1787). [[Aalborg Portland]] run by [[FLSmidth|F.L. Smidth]] was one of several cement factories operating in 1913, together employing some 800 workers.&lt;ref name=dka&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=73 |title=Danmarks Købstæder: Aalborg|language=Danish|accessdate=21 August 2013|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, Aalborg was being promoted as &quot;Denmark's new centre for industry and workers&quot;.&lt;ref name=pd/&gt; Replanning continued with additional thoroughfares cutting through the city. The port facilities were also improved with the help of a dredger and the opening of new docks. In 1933, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] inaugurated a new bridge over Limfjord to replace the fragile pontoon crossing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepsen1986&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Tyske soldater i konflikt med befolkningen (6045726754) (2).jpg|thumb|right|German soldiers in conflict with Aalborg citizens (August 1943)]]

Aalborg Airport, officially opened in 1938 because of the success of the cement industry, had in fact operated flights to Copenhagen since 1936.&lt;ref name=al&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aal.dk/om-aalborg-lufthavn/historie/#.UhSTmiqAzmI |title=Aalborg Lufthavns historie |language=Danish |accessdate=21 August 2013 |publisher=Aalborg Lufthavn |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021055501/http://www.aal.dk/om-aalborg-lufthavn/historie/ |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion of Denmark]] in 1940, the airport was captured by German [[paratrooper]]s on the night of the 21 April as a base for German aircraft flying to Norway.{{sfn|Sevaldsen|Bjørke|Bjørn|2003|p=316}} On 13 August 1940, a dozen [[Bristol Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 82 Squadron RAF]] were launched against the Luftwaffe airfield during one of the most disastrous [[Royal Air Force]] raids of the war. One turned back because of fuel problems, but all of the remaining 11 were shot down by enemy fighters and/or flak batteries within 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flensted.eu.com/194014.shtml |author=Søren C.

By 1960, Aalborg had become known as the &quot;city of smoking chimneys&quot;, with half of the inhabitants working in industry or manufacturing.&lt;ref name=dka/&gt; Ten years later, Aalborg's population had grown to around 97,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=au/&gt;

===Recent history===
[[File:Aalborg Havnefront - marts.JPG|thumbnail|left|Aalborg Waterfront]]
The significance of Aalborg's industry began to decline in the 1970s, precipitating a fall in the city's population until about 1990, when it began to increase again. By the year 2000, the service and education sectors accounted for about 60 percent of the workforce, partly as a result of the founding of [[Aalborg University]] in 1974. Since 1970, Aalborg and the northern suburb of Nørresundby have become a major administrative centre, thanks in part to the offices of the [[Region Nordjylland]] established in the east of the city.&lt;ref name=dka/&gt; In addition to large industrial companies including Aalborg Portland, the only cement-producing company in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aalborg Portland |url=http://www.stateofgreen.com/en/Profiles/Aalborg-Portland |publisher=State of Green |accessdate=31 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222163911/http://www.stateofgreen.com/en/Profiles/Aalborg-Portland |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the building products company Eternit,  many small and medium-sized enterprises have been established.

[[File:Denmark-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|right|250px|Map showing location (as Ålborg) in Denmark]]
Aalborg is in [[North Denmark Region|North Jutland]] (northwestern Denmark), at the narrowest point of the [[Limfjord]],{{sfn|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=294}} a shallow [[sound (geography)|sound]] that separates [[North Jutlandic Island]] (Vendsyssel-Thy) from the rest of the [[Jutland Peninsula]] and connects Aalborg to the [[Kattegat]] about {{convert|35|km}} to the east. Aalborg is {{convert|118|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Aarhus]], {{convert|82|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Randers]], and {{convert|64|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Frederikshavn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;&gt;{{Google maps | url =https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=57.05,9.916667&amp;q=loc:57.05,9.916667&amp;hl=en&amp;t=h&amp;z=12  | accessdate =31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is {{convert|414|km|0|abbr=on}} by [[Great Belt Fixed Link]] to [[Copenhagen]],  {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}} by the Frederikshavn-Göteborg ferry to [[Gothenburg]] in Sweden, and {{convert|363|km|0|abbr=on}} by the Frederikshavn-Oslo ferry to [[Oslo]] in Norway.

The area close to the waterfront is low-lying, with an elevation averaging about {{convert|5|m}},&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt; but there are many hills in and around city, some reaching over {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=climbs&gt;[http://www.climbs.dk/aalborg.htm &quot;Aalborg - Nørresundby: Bakker&quot;], Danmarks største bakker. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 4 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nørresundby, on the northern side of the sound, is also a hilly area.&lt;ref name=climbs/&gt; Villages to the south of Aalborg from west to east include [[Frejlev]], [[Svenstrup, Aalborg Municipality|Svenstrup]], and [[Gistrup]] (which contains extensive woodland to the south as well as a golf club). [[Klarup]] and [[Storvorde]] lie to the southeast along the 595 road,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt; which, flanking a stretch of the Limfjord known as Langerak, leads to the town of [[Hals, Denmark|Hals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt; [[Nibe]], with a harbour on the Limfjord, is {{convert|21|km}} to the southwest, past the village of Frejlev. The Nibe Broads (Nibe Bredning) in the Limfjord not only has the largest [[Zostera|eelgrass]] belts in Danish waters but is an important sanctuary for thousands of migratory birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natur-vesthimmerland.dk/Nibebred.htm|author=Albert Steen-Hansen|title=Nibe Bredning |publisher=Natur-vesthimmerland.dk|accessdate=5 September 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north of the city, villages include [[Vadum]], [[Aabybro]], [[Vestbjerg]], [[Sulsted]], [[Tylstrup]], [[Vodskov]], and [[Hjallerup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt; There is an extensive plantation, Branths Plantage - Møgelbjerg, immediately north of Vodskov.

The [[Himmerland]] region to the south still has a number of moors which once formed a vast area of heathland extending {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} to the [[Rold Skov|Rold Forest]] near [[Arden Municipality|Arden]]. Rebild Hills in the Rold Forest stretch over {{convert|425|acres|0|abbr=on}} of rolling heath country about {{convert|30|km}} south of Aalborg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagel Travel Guide Series: Scandinavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NnXAAAAMAAJ|year=1964|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lille Vildmose]], to the southeast, is reported to be the largest [[raised bog]] in north-western Europe.&lt;ref name=quick&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/quick-facts/map-of-denmark/aalborg/|title=Aalborg – a city of taste|accessdate=2 September 2013|publisher=Official Website of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The city===
The city centre, dating from the Middle Ages, lies on a series of clay banks between the former streams of Vesterå and Lilleå, which used to run into the sound. Despite effective drainage, the main streets, including Algade, still run east to west while the side streets run north to south. The Budolfi Church and the old town hall line Gammeltorv, the old market square. The main shopping streets are Algade and Bispengade, the latter lying inbetween the modern Vesterbro thoroughfare and Nytorv square. Østerågade, once the old harbor, is noted for its merchants' mansions.&lt;ref name=dsd /&gt;

The city cemetery, the Kilden park and the modern art museum, Kunsten, are in the modern commercial and administrative area around the railway station to the west. Beyond this, [[Hasseris]] has become a residential district with a number of large villas and detached houses. The city's main development area is now to the east of the centre although in addition to the university and new areas of housing, it still contains the shipping harbor, Østhavnen, and the cement factory. The waterfront to the northeast of the centre is being transformed from a harbour into a recreational area with the Utzon Center and [[Musikkens Hus]].&lt;ref name=dsd /&gt;

===Egholm===
[[File:Egholm SortSol da 090905.jpg|thumb|left|[[Egholm]]]]
Off the northwestern side of the city in the sound is the island of [[Egholm]], reached via ferry. The island, with a population of 55 {{As of|2013|lc=y}}, covers an area of {{convert|6.05|km2}} and consists mainly of farmland although there are still a few untilled areas of salt marshes and woodland. Dikes have been built along the coastline to protect the island from flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egholm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/kultur-og-fritid/natur/naturomraader/egholm/sider/egholm.aspx|title=Egholm - øen i Limfjorden|publisher=Aalborg Kommune|language=Danish|accessdate=31 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114131608/http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/kultur-og-fritid/Natur/Naturomraader/Egholm/Sider/Egholm.aspx|archivedate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kronborg Forest on the island, covering an area of {{convert|17|ha}}, was acquired by the municipal government in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egholm&quot;/&gt; A restaurant in the vicinity was established in 1918 but rebuilt in 1946 following a fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egholm&quot;/&gt; To the west of Egholm is the smaller uninhabited Fruensholm,&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Juul Rasmussen, [http://kajaksnak.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/fruensholm/ &quot;Fruensholm&quot;], Kajaksnakken (Rasmussen's blog). {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 8 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also three small islands to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;

===Lakes and chalk deposits===
There are several man-made lakes nearby: [[Lindholm Kridtgrav]] lies to the northwest of [[Skanse Park]] on the northern side of Limfjord, while [[Nordens Kridtgrav]] to the northwest of [[Mølleparken]] is on the southern side.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt; The Aalborg area is one of three in Denmark where [[chalk]] deposits are found (the others being [[Møns Klint]] and [[Stevns Peninsula|Stevns]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/It,_teknik_og_naturvidenskab/Geologi_og_kartografi/Sediment%C3%A6re_r%C3%A5stoffer/kalk|title=Kalk|language=Danish|accessdate=22 August 2013|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest quarry is at Rørdal in Øster Sundby ({{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east of the city centre), while Vokslev ({{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} to the west) has also provided chalk. Clay is also quarried in Østerådalen in the southern outskirts, making the area ideal for cement production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2dgf.dk/xpdf/bull53-1-93-110w.pdf |format=pdf|author=Erik Stenestad|title=Fluviokarst in the top of the Maastrichtian chalk at Rørdal, Northern Jutland, Denmark|accessdate=22 August 2013|publisher= Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark Vol. 53|pages= 93–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks and green spaces===
[[File:LindealleKildeparkenForaar2009.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Kildeparken]]]]
The {{convert|6.5|ha}} [[Østre Anlæg (Aalborg)|Østre Anlæg]] park is one of the oldest in Aalborg, visited by up to 175,000 people a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/kultur-og-fritid/Parker-og-groenne-omraader/Sider/Oestre-Anlaeg.aspx|title=Østre Anlæg|publisher=Aalborg Kommune|language=Danish|accessdate=21 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527155114/http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/kultur-og-fritid/Parker-og-groenne-omraader/Sider/Oestre-Anlaeg.aspx|archivedate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a dumping ground in the 1920s before being cleaned up and made into a recreational area in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostre&quot;/&gt; It contains lawns, flowers, tall trees, bushes, and a lake, overlooked by St. Mark's Church on the eastern side. Fifty-one species of bird have been recorded in the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostre&quot;/&gt;

Lindholm Fjordpark, to the south of the Lindholm's industrial park, forms part of the green sector of the city known as 'Ryåkilen' along the coast of the sound, covering roughly {{convert|50|ha}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lind fjord&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/kultur-og-fritid/Parker-og-groenne-omraader/Sider/Lindholm-Fjordpark.aspx|title=Lindholm Fjordpark|publisher=Aalborg Kommune|language=Danish|accessdate=21 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803011155/http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/kultur-og-fritid/Parker-og-groenne-omraader/Sider/Lindholm-Fjordpark.aspx|archivedate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Østre Anlæg, it once served as a waste site with landfill, and a housing estate was built on its northeastern side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lind fjord&quot;/&gt; Its use as a landfill site was gradually discontinued in the 1990s, and in 1996, extensive restoration work began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lind fjord&quot;/&gt; Today it has woodlands and open areas with grass and herbaceous vegetation, notably [[buckthorn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lind fjord&quot;/&gt; It is also a habitat for many species of migratory birds such as [[brant goose|light-bellied brent geese]], [[curlew]]s, and songbirds. The park is also used by the Nordjysk Windsurfing Club and has a six-hole golf course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lind fjord&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Karolinelund - Boomerang.jpg|thumb|A rollercoaster at [[Karolinelund]]]]

Aalborg has a number of additional civic parks and recreational facilities. Among them are [[Kildeparken]], which hosts the annual [[Aalborg Carnival]], Mølleparken, which contains a pond, statues, an outdoor exercise facility, and a 2.5 kilometre (1.6&amp;nbsp;mi) jogging trail (within the trail lies the ''Lysløjpen'', a 45 metre [148&amp;nbsp;ft] gradient), Sohngårdsholmpark, a wooded area containing trails for both walking/jogging and biking and a six-hole golf course (free to the public), the Aalborg Open Air Swimming Pool, also free to the public, Bundgårdsparken, and Lindholm Strandpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaalborg.com/ln-int/aalborg/parks-and-green-areas-aalborg|title=Parks and Green Areas in Aalborg|publisher=VisitAalborg|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aalborg Zoo]] was opened in 1935 and typically houses 1,300 animals from 138 different species, including [[tiger]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, [[zebra]], [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[penguin]]s and [[polar bear]]s.{{sfn|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=297}} It is one of the area's major tourist attractions with over 300,000 visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aalborgzoo.dk/about.aspx|title=About the Zoo|accessdate=25 August 2013|publisher=Aalborg Zoo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922133132/http://www.aalborgzoo.dk/about.aspx|archivedate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the zoo an African savannah has been created where exotic animals are housed.&lt;ref name=quick/&gt;

Aalborg was home to an amusement park, [[Karolinelund]], founded in 1946. In 2005, still owned by the founding family, it was sold to an entrepreneur who resold it to the city the following year. When the park closed in 2010, it was home to 17 attractions. Recently, the city has reopened the park to volunteers who wish to return it to operating status. The park is once again open to the public as a leisure facility but without rides and attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/Om_kommunen/Byplanlaegning/Byomdannelse-og-byudvikling/Sider/Karolinelund.aspx|title=Karolinelund|publisher=Aalborg Kommune|accessdate=20 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913034243/http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/Om_kommunen/Byplanlaegning/Byomdannelse-og-byudvikling/Sider/Karolinelund.aspx|archivedate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association, Platform4, a non-profit user-driven project-oriented venue that experiments with technology (electronics) in combination with artistic genres is now located in the park.  Volunteers frequently arrange seminars, exhibitions, films, music concerts, and more which are open to the public.

Many of the factories have now closed, to be replaced by developments in the knowledge-based and green-energy sectors.{{sfn|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=294}} Mobile and wireless communications industries have grown substantially since the 1990s, as has rotor production for wind turbines.

In January 2011, there were some 9,200 enterprises in Aalborg, employing around 109,000 people or approximately 35% of the workforce of the Northern Region. In the 2010s, the city is set on increasing its participation in the global economy through both existing companies and new entrants. Its efforts are focused on four areas: energy and environment, information technology, health support systems and &quot;Arctic business&quot;. The latter covers trade with Greenland as the [[Port of Aalborg]] handles over 60% of all goods shipped to Greenland. Four harbours dot the waterfront, Marina Fjordparken, Skudehavnen, Vestre Badehavn, and Østre Havn. Tourism is also growing, with a considerable rise in the number of passengers at Aalborg Airport. Aalborg Municipality has Denmark's second highest revenue from tourism and is the only municipality in the north of Denmark where overnight stays are increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/aalborgkommune/427/|title=Den globale erhvervsby: Erhvervsplan 2010 – 2014|language=Danish|accessdate=21 August 2013|publisher=Aalborg Kommune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/SiteCollectionDocuments/WeLoveBusiness.pdf|format=pdf|title=We Love Business|language=Danish|accessdate=25 August 2013|publisher=Aalborg Kommune|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926104855/http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/SiteCollectionDocuments/WeLoveBusiness.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jomfru Ane Gade]] (literally Virgin Anne's Street) is one of the most famous streets in Aalborg if not in Denmark. Popular for its cafés and restaurants during the day, it is even busier at night with its clubs, discos and bars. During the 1990s, the street was infamously a 'hang out' of two [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gangs]] who were at war for some years all over Scandinavia. As the bikers disappeared it became increasingly popular for people of all ages.&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;&lt;ref name=jag&gt;[http://www.visitaalborg.dk/denmark/jomfru-ane-gade-gdk596155 &quot;Jomfru Ane Gade&quot;], VisitAalborg. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 21 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The pedestrian hubs of [[Nytorv Square]] and [[John F.

==Religion==
===Lutheranism===
[[File:Aalborg Danmark Sct Budolfi Kirke er Aalborgs domkirke Foto 2010 Wolfgang Pehlemann Steinberg Ostsee IMG 6662.jpg|thumb|left|Budolfi Church]]
The principal religion in Aalborg as in the rest of Denmark is [[Christianity]]. Aalborg is the seat of a [[bishop]] within the [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran State Church of Denmark]]. The cathedral of this bishopric is the [[Budolfi Church]], originally built no later than 1132 by [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]]'s Bishop Eskil. This church was considerably smaller than the current one, as it was merely a parish church. The existing structure was completed in the late 14th century, on the grounds of the former church, and was listed for the first time in the Atlas of Denmark in 1399. The church was named after [[St Botolph]], an English [[abbot]] and saint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkens&quot;&gt;&quot;Kirkens Historie&quot; Aalborg Domkirke@www.aalborgdomkirke.dk&lt;/ref&gt; The church is constructed in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkens&quot;/&gt; In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and, after consideration, St Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg. Aalborg is also home to the former Catholic church, the [[Abbey of Our Lady, Aalborg|Abbey of Our Lady]], converted from a [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] nunnery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vorfruekirke.dk|title=Abbey of Our Lady|publisher=Vorfruekirke|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Churches====
The present [[Budolfi Church]], which has the status of a cathedral, dates from the end of the 14th century, although at least two earlier churches stood on the same spot. Built in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, it consists of a nave flanked by two aisles, a tower, and a porch. After the original tower was destroyed by fire in 1663, the striking new Baroque tower, based on that of an earlier [[Copenhagen City Hall (1728–1795)|Copenhagen city hall]], was completed in 1779. The church has 16th-century frescoes and an intricately carved early Baroque [[altarpiece]] from 1689 created by [[Lauridtz Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aalborgdomkirke.dk/ny.aspx|author=Niels Clemmensen|title=Alborg Domkirke - Budolfi Kirke|language=Danish|accessdate=23 August 2013|publisher= Aalborg Domkirke }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VorFrueKirke-Aalborg-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abbey of Our Lady, Aalborg|Abbey of Our Lady]] (''Vor Frue Kirke'') ]]
[[Abbey of Our Lady, Aalborg|Abbey of Our Lady]] (''Vor Frue Kirke'') was designed in 1878 by [[Johannes Emil Gnudtzmann|J.E. Gnudtzmann]] in the Neo-Romanesque style. The original Church of Our Lady from the early 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation because it was old and unstable, but the 12th-century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen. The carved [[pulpit]] dates to around 1581.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepsen1986&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitaalborg.com/ln-int/denmark/vor-frue-kirke---church-of-our-lady-gdk596532|title=Vor Frue Kirke - Church of Our Lady|accessdate=23 August 2013|publisher= VisitAalborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the considerable population increase from the end of the 19th century, a number of new churches were built in various styles. Next to [[Aalborg Hall]], Ansgar's Church with its tall tower was built in 1929 to a design by [[Hother August Paludan]] in a modern Baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansgarskirken.dk/om.aspx|title=Om kirken|language=Danish|accessdate=25 August 2013|publisher=Ansgars Kirken|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124401/http://www.ansgarskirken.dk/om.aspx|archivedate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Mark's Church (''Sankt Markus Kirke''), completed in 1933, was designed by [[Einar Packness]]. Its tower is crowned by an imposing spire. The Biblical figures known as the Johannes Group (based on Christ's meeting with [[John the Baptist]] in [[Gospel of St Matthew|Matthew]], Chapter 3) sculpted by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] are displayed around the interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepsen1986&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanktmarkus.dk/om-kirken/ |title=Om kirken|language=Danish|accessdate=25 August 2013|publisher=Sankt Markus Aalborg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Margrethe Church with its steeply sloping roof reaching {{convert|22|m|abbr=on}} is the work of Carlo Odgaard and Aaby Sørensen. [[Bent Exner]] designed some of the artefacts in the church including the crucifix over the altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://margrethekirken.dk/Kirkens_historie|title=Lidt kirkehistorie|language=Danish|accessdate=25 August 2013|publisher=Margrethekirken Aalborg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205128/http://margrethekirken.dk/Kirkens_historie|archivedate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cemeteries====
Aalborg's cemeteries have a history dating to the end of the Middle Ages. Sankt Jørgens Kirkegård (St George's Cemetery) was on the corner of Hasserisgade and Kirkegårdsgade. The site was chosen in a district outside the city as it provided isolation for those affected by the plague, many of whom died in the neighbouring hospice, Sankt Jørgens Gårde. In 1794, a new cemetery was opened in Klostermarken, immediately to the south of Sankt Jørgens Kirkegård. It was further extended in 1804, 1820 and 1870. It is now known as Aalborgs [[Almen Kirkegård]] (meaning &quot;common cemetery&quot;) and contains the graves of many of the city's most notable citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/Borger/sundhed-og-sygdom/doedsfald-og-begravelse/Kirkegaarde/Documents/Kendte-personer-begravet-paa-Almen-Kirkegaard.pdf |format=pdf |title=Almen Kirkegård |language=Danish |accessdate=2 September 2013 |publisher=Aalborg Kommune }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Aalborg had a [[synagogue]], built in 1854; and the [[Judaism|Jewish]] rabbi Salomon Mielziner served it for 35 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewgen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/scandinavia/aalborg.htm|title=Scandinavia Special Interest Group (SIG) Aalborg|publisher=Jewishgen.org|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services were no longer offered after Mielziner died, and in 1924 the synagogue was donated to the city government, which began using it to store the city archives (Stadsarkivet).&lt;ref name=&quot;jewgen&quot;/&gt; It was burned down by the [[Schalburg Corps]] in April 1945 towards the end of World War II, destroying its centuries-old [[Torah]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewgen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1945/04/10/archive/germans-set-danish-synagogue-afire-destroy-centuries-old-torahs|title=Germans Set Danish Synagogue Afire, Destroy Centuries-old Torahs|publisher=Sydvenska Dagbladet, via The Global Jewish News Source|date=10 April 1945|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-semitism]] continues to exist in Denmark, and in 1999, an unlicensed Nazi radio station began operating from a neo-Nazi stronghold in Fynen, [[Nørresundby]], within Aalborg municipality.{{Sfn|Roth|2001|p=70}} The activity has been widely denounced with organized opposition in Aalborg and the rest of Denmark, and in February 1999, 12 anti-fascists were arrested for possession of explosives at their base in Fynen.{{Sfn|Roth|2001|p=70}}
