      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''SRA-shooting''' is a shooting sport based on the concept of [[practical shooting]]. It originates from [[Finland]]. Whole name is '''''s'''ovellettu '''r'''eserviläis'''a'''mmunta'' and translates as ''applied [[reservist]]s' shooting''. It resembles [[International Practical Shooting Confederation|IPSC]] a lot. The objective of the sport is to develop the weapon handling and marksmanship skills of the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ifsra.net/about/|title=About SRA|date=2017-11-13|work=IFSRA|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the sport are regulated by the [[Finnish Reservist Sports Federation]] (RESUL). International Federation SRA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ifsra.net/|title=IFSRA|website=IFSRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the global governing body of the sport. .

In IPSC it is strictly forbidden to wear any [[military]] styled clothes unless competitor is in active service. In SRA military outlook is promoted. Unlike IPSC where guns are divided in different divisions by structure and power, SRA concentrates in firearms and [[caliber]]s used by military or paramilitary organisations. Main emphasis is on [[rifle]]s while [[pistol]] shooting is primary in IPSC.

Target used in SRA are resembling human like figure (metric) while classic target in IPSC is stretched octagon.
