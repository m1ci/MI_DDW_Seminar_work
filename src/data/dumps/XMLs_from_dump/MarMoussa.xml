'''MarMoussa''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;مار موسى&lt;/big&gt;}}, also spelled '''Mar-Moussa''') is a town in [[Lebanon]] in the [[Matn District]] of [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]]. It is {{cvt|25|km}} from [[Beirut]] at an altitude ranging between {{convert|900|and|1150|m}} above [[sea level]].

== History ==

In 1753, a group of Lebanese monks built the monastery of Mar Moussa Al-Habshi over the remains of an old Roman sanctuary. In later years, migrant families from Jbail, Chbaniyé, and Bikfaya settled in the area, where they were employed to cultivate the monastery's lands. Gradually, the community grew into the village called Mar Moussa Ed-Douar. With government financial assistance in the 1950s, the resident farmers obtained ownership of the land and began expanding the village. Since then, many villas and houses have been built in the surrounding area, which is full of pine trees. The village's most prominent landmarks are the monastery and the windmill.

== Demography ==

The inhabitants of MarMoussa are followers of the [[Maronite Catholic Church]].{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Like most mountain villages in Lebanon, MarMoussa is home to a historic Maronite monastery: Deir Mar Moussa (Saint Moussa Monastery). Built in 1753, Deir Mar Moussa Al-Habshi is constructed of white stones and consists of several long buildings with bricks on top, surrounded by trees. It was built over the remains of an old sanctuary. In the monastery there is a small church dedicated to [[St. Charbel]] and shrines for [[Rafqa Pietra Choboq Ar-Rayès|St. Rafqa]] (a Maronite Lebanese nun [[beatified]] in 1985 and [[canonized]] in 2001) and Na’amatallah Al-Hardini (a Lebanese monk who was declared [[venerable]] in 1989 and beatified in 1998). The courtyard of Deir Mar Moussa overlooks terraces and the pine mountains of [[Bzebdine]], as well as [[Mount Kneysseh]].
