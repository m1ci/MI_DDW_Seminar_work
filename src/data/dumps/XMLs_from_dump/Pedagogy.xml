'''Pedagogy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ə|ɡ|ɒ|dʒ|i|,_|-|ɡ|oʊ|dʒ|i|,_|-|ɡ|ɒ|ɡ|i}}), most commonly understood as the approach to teaching, refers to the theory and practice of [[learning]], and how this process influences, and is influenced by, the social, political and [[psychological development]] of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly, as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Li, G., 2012. Culturally contested pedagogy: Battles of literacy and schooling between mainstream teachers and Asian immigrant parents. Suny Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedagogy is often described as the act of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedagogy|title=Definition of PEDAGOGY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=9 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions, judgments, and other teaching strategies by taking into consideration [[Learning theory (education)|theories of learning]], understandings of students and their needs, and the backgrounds and interests of individual students.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/school/teachers/support/learnteachbgpaper.pdf|title=Blueprint for government schools. Flagship strategy 1: Student Learning.

Conventional western pedagogies view the teacher as knowledge holder and student as the recipient of knowledge (described by Paulo Freire as &quot;banking methods&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P., 2018. Pedagogy of the oppressed. Bloomsbury Publishing USA.&lt;/ref&gt;), but theories of pedagogy increasingly identify the student as an agent, and the teacher as a facilitator.

Instructive strategies are governed by the pupil's background knowledge and experience, situation, and environment, as well as [[learning]] [[goal]]s set by the student and teacher. One example would be the [[Socratic method]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrie et al. (2009). [http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/58/1/may_18_09_Ped_BRIEFING__PAPER_JB_PP_.pdf Pedagogy – a holistic, personal approach to work with children and young people, across services. p. 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of adults, as a specific group, is referred to as [[andragogy]].

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word is a derivative of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:παιδαγωγία#Ancient Greek|παιδαγωγία]]}} (''paidagōgia''), from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:παιδαγωγός#Ancient Greek|παιδαγωγός]]}} (''paidagōgos''), itself a synthesis of {{lang|grc|ἄγω}} (''ágō''),  &quot;I lead&quot;, and {{lang|grc|παῖς}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|país}}, genitive {{lang|grc|παιδός}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|paidos}}) &quot;boy, child&quot;: hence, &quot;attendence on boys, to lead a child&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/pedagogy#etymonline_v_30327 &quot;pedagogy&quot;]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is pronounced variously, as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ə|ɡ|ɒ|dʒ|i}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ə|ɡ|oʊ|dʒ|i}}, or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ə|ɡ|ɒ|ɡ|i}}.&lt;ref name=CollinsED&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pedagogy|title=Definition of &quot;pedagogy&quot; – Collins English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CambridgeED&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/pedagogy?q=pedagogy |title=pedagogy noun – definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus – Cambridge Dictionary Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative [[connotation]]s of [[pedant]]ry have sometimes been intended, or taken, at least from the time of [[Samuel Pepys]] in the 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pedagogue &quot;pedagogue&quot;].

==History==
{{Expand section | 1 = History of pedagogy before and after Johann Friedrich Herbart | small = no | talksection= History incomplete |date=October 2018}}

===Herbartianism===
{{Main|Herbartianism}}
The educational philosophy and pedagogy of [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (4 May 1776 – 14 August 1841) highlighted the correlation between [[personal development]] and the resulting benefits to society. In other words, Herbart proposed that humans become fulfilled once they establish themselves as productive citizens. Herbartianism refers to the movement underpinned by Herbart's theoretical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Herbartianism {{!}} education|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/Herbartianism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the teaching process, Herbart suggested five steps as crucial components. Specifically, these five steps include: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Johann Friedrich Herbart {{!}} biography – German educator|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Friedrich-Herbart|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbart suggests that pedagogy relates to having assumptions as an educator and a specific set of abilities with a deliberate end goal in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Educational Theory as Topological Rhetoric: The Concepts of Pedagogy of Johann Friedrich Herbart and Friedrich Schleiermacher|journal = Studies in Philosophy and Education|date = 12 February 2012|issn = 0039-3746|pages = 265–273|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s11217-012-9287-6|first = Karsten|last = Kenklies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogical considerations==

===Hidden curriculum===
{{Main|Hidden curriculum}}
A hidden curriculum is a side effect of an education, &quot;[lessons] which are learned but not openly intended&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin, Jane 1983&quot;&gt;Martin, Jane. &quot;What Should We Do with a Hidden Curriculum When We Find One?&quot; The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 122–139.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the transmission of norms, values, and beliefs conveyed in the classroom and the social environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giroux 1983&quot;&gt;Giroux, Henry and Anthony Penna. &quot;Social Education in the Classroom: The Dynamics of the Hidden Curriculum.&quot; The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 100–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning space===
{{Main|Learning space}}
Learning space or learning setting refers to a physical setting for a [[learning environment]], a place in which teaching and learning occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3068197 | pmid=21461133 | doi=10.1109/MIS.2010.112 | volume=2010 | issue=99 | title=Learning Setting-Generalized Activity Models for Smart Spaces | year=2010 | journal=IEEE Intell Syst | page=1 | last1 = Cook | first1 = DJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used as a more definitive alternative to &quot;[[classroom]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edglossary.org/learning-environment/ Eglossary, definition].  Retrieved 5 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; but it may also refer to an indoor or outdoor location, either actual or virtual.  Learning spaces are highly diverse in use, learning styles, configuration, location, and educational institution. They support a variety of pedagogies, including quiet study, passive or active learning, kinesthetic or physical learning, vocational learning, experiential learning, and others.

===Learning theories===
{{Main|Learning theory (education)}}
Learning theories are [[conceptual framework]]s describing how knowledge is absorbed, processed, and retained during [[learning]]. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Illeris | first = Knud | title = The three dimensions of learning | publisher = Krieger Pub. Co | location = Malabar, Fla | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781575242583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ormrod | first = Jeanne | title = Human learning | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston | year = 2012|edition = 6th | isbn = 9780132595186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distance learning===
{{Main|Distance education}}
Distance education or long-distance learning is the education of students who may not always be physically present at a [[school]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan Haenlein 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=Andreas M.|last2=Haenlein|first2=Michael|year=2016|title=Higher education and the digital revolution: About MOOCs, SPOCs, social media, and the Cookie Monster|journal=Business Horizons|volume=59|issue=4|pages=441–50|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Honeyman|first=M|author2=Miller, G|date=December 1993|title=Agriculture distance education: A valid alternative for higher education?|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED366794.pdf#page=80|journal=Proceedings of the 20th Annual National Agricultural Education Research Meeting|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, this usually involved correspondence courses wherein the student corresponded with the school via [[Mail|post]]. Today it involves online education.

[[Massive open online course]]s (MOOCs), offering large-scale interactive participation and open access through the [[World Wide Web]] or other network technologies, are recent developments in distance education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan Haenlein 2016&quot; /&gt; A number of other terms (distributed learning, e-learning, online learning, etc.) are used roughly synonymously with distance education.

==Pedagogical approaches==

===Critical pedagogy===
{{Main|Critical pedagogy}}
Critical pedagogy is both a pedagogical approach and a broader [[social movement]]. Critical pedagogy acknowledges that educational practices are contested and shaped by history, schools are not [[Politics|politically]] neutral spaces and teaching is political. Decisions regarding the [[curriculum]], disciplinary practices, [[Test (assessment)|student testing]], [[textbook]] selection, the language used by the teacher, and more can empower or disempower students. It recognises that educational practices favour some students over others and some practices harm all students. It also recognises that educational practices often favour some voices and perspectives while marginalising or ignoring others. Another aspect examined is the [[Power (social and political)|power]] the teacher holds over students and the implications of this. Its aims include empowering students to become active and engaged [[Citizenship|citizens]], who are able to actively improve their own lives and their [[Community|communities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Pedagogy Primer|last=Kincheloe|first=Joe|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2008|isbn=9781433101823|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical pedagogical practices may include, listening to and including students' knowledge and perspectives in class, making connections between school and the broader community, and posing problems to students that encourage them to question assumed knowledge and understandings. The goal of problem posing to students is to enable them to begin to pose their own problems. Teachers acknowledge their position of authority and exhibit this authority through their actions that support students.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

===Dialogic learning===
{{Main|Dialogic learning}}
Dialogic learning is [[learning]] that takes place through [[dialogue]]. It is typically the result of [[egalitarian dialogue]]; in other words, the consequence of a dialogue in which different people provide [[arguments]] based on [[Validity (logic)|validity]] claims and not on [[power (philosophy)|power]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Praeger Handbook of Education and Psychology

|editor1-first=Joe L.|editor1-last=Kincheloe|editor2-first=Raymond A.|editor2-last= Horn|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student-centered learning===
{{Main|Student-centred learning}}
Student-centered learning, also known as learner-centered education, broadly encompasses methods of [[teaching]] that shift the focus of instruction from the [[teacher]] to the [[student]]. In original usage, student-centered learning aims to develop learner autonomy and independence&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Leo. (2007). The Student-Centered Classroom. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by putting responsibility for the learning path in the hands of students.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C. R. (1983). Freedom to Learn for the 80's. New York: Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company, A Bell &amp; Howell Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, S., &amp; Liu, M. (2003). Teachers' beliefs about issues in the implementation of a student-centered learning environment. Educational Technology Research and Development, 51(2), 57–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hannafin&quot;&gt;Hannafin, M. J., &amp; Hannafin, K. M. (2010).

In Learning and instruction in the digital age (pp. 11–23). Springer US.&lt;/ref&gt; Student-centered instruction focuses on skills and practices that enable [[lifelong learning]] and independent problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Nursing: Developing a Student-centered Learning Environment|page= 5

|first1=Lynne E.|last1=Young|first2=Barbara L. |last2=Paterson |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic degrees==
An [[academic degree]], Ped. D., [[Doctorate|Doctor]] of Pedagogy, is awarded honorarily by some US universities to distinguished teachers (in the US and UK, earned degrees within the instructive field are classified as an Ed. D., [[Doctor of Education]] or a PhD [[Doctor of Philosophy]]). The term is also used to denote an emphasis in education as a specialty in a field (for instance, a [[Doctor of Music]] degree in [[piano pedagogy]]).

==Pedagogues in Europe==
The education of pedagogues, and their role in society, varies greatly from culture to culture.

=== Denmark ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-41637-0004,_Boldekow,_Blick_in_den_Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Four kindergarten children play with toy trucks on a table and a teacher sits with them while they play|Kindergarten children playing with their teacher.]]

In Scandinavia, a pedagogue (''pædagog'') is broadly speaking a practitioner of pedagogy, but the term is primarily reserved for individuals who occupy jobs in [[pre-school]] [[education]] (such as [[kindergarten]]s and [[nursery school|nurseries]]). A pedagogue can occupy various kinds of jobs, within this restrictive definition, e.g. in [[retirement home]]s, [[prison]]s, [[orphanage]]s, and [[human resource management]]. When working with at-risk families or youths they are referred to as social pedagogues (''socialpædagog'').

The pedagogue's job is usually distinguished from a [[teacher]]'s by primarily focusing on teaching children life-preparing knowledge such as [[social skills|social]] or non-curriculum skills, and [[cultural norms]]. There is also a very big focus on care and well-being of the child. Many pedagogical institutions also practice [[social inclusion]]. The pedagogue's work also consists of supporting the child in their mental and social development.&lt;ref&gt;Taipei Times [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/03/22/2003298639 Learning from Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark all pedagogues are educated at a series of national institutes for social educators located all major cities. The education is a 3.5-year academic course, giving the student the title of a [[bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] in Social Education (Danish: ''Professionsbachelor som pædagog'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.via.dk/uddannelser/paedagogik-og-laering/paedagog|title=Pædagog|trans-title=Pedagogue|language=Danish|publisher=[[Ministry of Children and Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Children and Education]]|website=UddannelsesGuiden|accessdate=1 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Educational Guide – Denmark [http://www.ug.dk/job/paedagogiskkirkeligtogsocialtarbejde/paedagogiskarb/paedagog.aspx Pædagog – UddannelsesGuiden.dk].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to earn a master's degree in pedagogy/educational science from the University of Copenhagen. This BA and MA program has a more theoretical focus compared to the more vocational Bachelor in Social Education.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, the word pedagogue (''pedagógus'') is synonymous with teacher (''tanár''); therefore, teachers of both primary and secondary schools may be referred to as pedagogues, a word that appears also in the name of their lobbyist organizations and labor unions (e.g.  Labor Union of Pedagogues, Democratic Labor Union of Pedagogues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Front Page|url=http://www.pedagogusok.hu/|work=The Official Site of The Labor Union of Pedagogues|publisher=Labor Union of Pedagogues|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, undergraduate education in Pedagogy does not qualify students to become teachers in primary or secondary schools but makes them able to apply to be educational assistants. As of 2013, the 6-year training period was re-installed in place of the undergraduate and postgraduate division which characterized the previous practice.&lt;ref name=eduline&gt;{{cite news|title=Ezekre a tanári szakokra jelentkeztek a legtöbben [English: These Teaching Areas Proved The Most Popular] |url= http://eduline.hu/erettsegi_felveteli/2013/4/19/legnepszerubb_tanari_szakok_2013_7NXQ9F|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=Eduline|date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern pedagogy==
An article from Kathmandu Post published on 3 June 2018 described the usual first day of school in an academic calendar. Teachers meet their students with distinct traits. Attributional diversity among these children or teens exceeds similarities. Educators have to teach students with different cultural, social, and religious backgrounds. This situation entails a differentiated strategy in pedagogy and not the traditional approach for teachers to accomplish goals efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-06-03/a-new-pedagogy.html|title=A new pedagogy|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American author and educator Carol Ann Tomlinson defined Differentiated Instruction as &quot;teachers' efforts in responding to inconsistencies among students in the classroom.&quot; Differentiation refers to methods of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/what-differentiated-instruction/|title=What Is Differentiated Instruction? {{!}} Scholastic|website=www.scholastic.com|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained that Differentiated Instruction gives learners a variety of alternatives for acquiring information. Primary principles comprising the structure of Differentiated Instruction include formative and ongoing assessment, group collaboration, recognition of students' diverse levels of knowledge, problem-solving, and choice in reading and writing experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/100216/chapters/Understanding-Differentiated-Instruction@-Building-a-Foundation-for-Leadership.aspx|title=Understanding Differentiated Instruction: Building a Foundation for Leadership|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Gardner, developmental psychologist from Harvard University and author of 30 books translated into 32 languages along with several hundreds of articles, gained prominence in the education sector for his Multiple Intelligences Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/howard-gardner|title=Howard Gardner|website=Harvard Graduate School of Education|language=en|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named seven of these intelligences in 1983. These are Linguistic, Logical and Mathematical, Visual and Spatial, Body and Kinesthetic, Musical and Rhythmic, Intrapersonal, and Interpersonal. Critics say the popular theory during the last 20 years is based only on Gardner's intuition instead of empirical data. Another criticism is that the intelligences are too identical for types of personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/gardners-multiple-intelligences-theory.html|title=Multiple Intelligences Theory (Gardner) – Learning Theories|date=17 July 2014|work=Learning Theories|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Howard Gardner came from cognitive research and states these intelligences help people to &quot;''know the world, understand themselves, and other people''.&quot; Said differences dispute an educational system that presumes students can &quot;''understand the same materials in the same manner and that a standardized, collective measure is very much impartial towards linguistic approaches in instruction and assessment as well as to some extent logical and quantitative styles''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tecweb.org/styles/gardner.html|title=Gardner's Multiple Intelligences|website=www.tecweb.org|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}
