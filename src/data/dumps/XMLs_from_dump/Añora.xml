'''Añora''' is a city located in the [[Córdoba (Spanish province)|province of Córdoba]], Spain. According to the 2014 [[census]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE)]]&lt;/ref&gt; the municipality has a population of 1,555 inhabitants. Its [[postal code]] is 14450.

==History==
Añora was founded as a village dependent on Torremilano at the end of the 14th century. It obtained its title as a separate town in 1553 and since then has been part of the Seven Towns of the Valley of ''[[Los Pedroches]], along with Pedroche, Torremilano, Torrecampo, Pozoblanco, Alcaracejos, and Villanueva de Córdoba.  From 1660 to 1747 these towns formed the Marquessate of Carpio.  Its municipal boundaries were not demarcated until the early 20th century.

[[Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja]], the child who lived by himself in the middle of the [[Sierra Morena]] in the area that is now the [[Sierra de Cardeña y Montoro Natural Park]], was born in Añora. The film “Entre lobos” by the Cordovan director Gerardo Olivares was based on this experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viajar.elperiodico.com/destinos/europa/espana/andalucia/cordoba/parajes-de-cordoba-para-una-escapada-entre-lobos Parajes de Córdoba para una escapada “entre lobos”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the elections of Feb. 16, 1936, Antonio Muñoz Moreno was named mayor by the [[Republican Left (Spain)|Republican Left]] party, a position which he was obliged to leave in early 1939 to join the [[Spanish Republican Army]]. After the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended, he handed himself over to the authorities and was detained and executed on 9 November 1939 in [[Pueblonuevo del Terrible]].
