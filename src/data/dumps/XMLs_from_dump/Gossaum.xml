'''''Gossaum''''' ({{korean|hangul=고싸움}}) is a traditional [[Sport in South Korea|Korean sport]] played in Chilseok village, [[Nam District, Gwangju|Nam-gu]] as part of the [[Korean New Year|New Year's celebrations]]. It is designated an [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwalliguk2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Korea (South).

==Setup==
===Go===
Each Go is around 15m long, and consists of a large straw loop at the end of a long, thick cylinder, supported on poles. Two &quot;tails&quot;, at the opposite end of the structure from the loop, serve to provide a rudimentary steering mechanism. During play, the two Go are lifted above head height by the teams, and the loops are brought into contact and pushed against one another. Due to the ritual nature of the contest, one team's Go is larger than the other, making the contest somewhat one-sided.&lt;ref name=&quot;mycong&quot;/&gt;

===Teams===
The teams are designated ''Dongbu'' (&quot;East&quot;) and ''Seobu'' (&quot;West&quot;), and wear blue and red respectively. Each team consists of around 70-80 people; including the ''Julpaejang'' or leader, who sits astride the Go and directs his team; the ''Gomen-saram'' or carriers, who lift the Go; and the ''Kkorijul-jabi'' or tail-holders (predominantly women) who steer the Go using its two tails. Each team also has a number of standby players who sing and shout chants of encouragement to the players.&lt;ref name=&quot;mycong&quot;/&gt;

==Gameplay==
At the command of the ''julpaejang'' the teams rush forward and ram the loops of their two Go against one another, attempting to drive the opposing team back or push its Go to the ground. If, after pushing, neither Go is dislodged, one of the ''julpaejang'' will give the order to retreat and the two Gos will separate before repeating the process. During such separations, the ''gomen-saram'' will raise and lower the Go to demonstrate their fighting spirit.

When one Go has been brought down four times, the game is over.&lt;ref name=&quot;mycong&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanʼguk Munhwa&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Hanʼguk Munhwa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GycOAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=1984|publisher=Korean Cultural Service|volume=5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gossaumnori==
''Gossaum'' plays the central role in the ''Gossaumnori'' festival. Other aspects of this [[fertility rite]] include prayers to the spirits of the local mountains and forests, exorcism rite, and traditional music and dancing. Because the Western side of the village is thought to represent [[fecundity]], the ''Seobu'' Go is larger than the ''Dongbu'' one, since only if ''Seobu'' win will the villager's prayers for a prosperous year be granted. Historically, in the event that no clear winner emerged, the Go would be dismantled and their straw ropes used in a [[Juldarigi|tug-of-war contest]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;mycong&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwalliguk2001&quot;/&gt;
