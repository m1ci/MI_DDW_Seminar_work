'''Achalpur,''' formerly known as '''Ellichpur''' and '''Illychpur''', is a city and a [[municipal council]] in [[Amravati District]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]]. It is the second most populous city in [[Amravati District]] after Amravati and seventh most populous city in Vidarbha. It has a twin city known as [[Paratwada]].

==History==
Achalpur or Ellichpur is first mentioned authentically in the 13th century as one of the famous cities of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Though tributary to the [[Delhi Sultanate]] after 1294, it remained under [[Hindu]] administration till 1318, when it came directly under the Muslim [[Delhi Sultanate]].

In 1347 Achalpur with the Berar region was ruled by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]].

In 1490 [[Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk]] proclaimed his independence and founded the Imad Shahi dynasty of the [[Berar Sultanate]]. He proceeded to annex [[Mahur, Maharashtra|Mahur]] to his new kingdom and established his capital at Ellichpur. It was afterwards capital of the [[Berar Subah]] at intervals until the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] occupation, when the seat of the provincial governor was moved to [[Balapur, Akola district|Balapur]]. The town retains many relics of the [[Berar Sultanate|Sultans of Berar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ellichpur|volume=9|page=291|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Mughal empire deteriorated in the 18th century, Achalpur along with the rest of Berar came under the rule of the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]]. In 1853, [[Berar Province]] came under [[British India|British]] administration, although it remained formally part of the [[Hyderabad state]] until 1903 when the province became the [[Berar Division]] of the [[Central Provinces]]. Achalpur, known by the British as Ellichpur, became part of East Berar, with Amraoti (Amravati) as capital of the division. In 1867 East Berar was split into the districts of [[Amravati District|Amraoti]] and [[Ellichpur district]], with Ellichpur as the headquarters of Ellichpur District. The district had an area of {{convert|2605|sqmi|km2}}.

In 1901 Achalpur had a population of 29,740, with ginning factories and a considerable trade in cotton and forest produce. It was connected by good roads with Amraoti and [[Chikhaldara]].  Berar was annexed to British India in 1903 and merged with the [[Central Provinces]], and in 1905 Ellichpur District was merged into Amraoti District. The civil station of [[Paratwada]], 5&amp;nbsp;km. from the town of Ellichpur, contained the principal public buildings at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot;/&gt;

After India's independence in 1947, the Central Provinces became the province, and after 1950 the state, [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The 1956 [[States Reorganisation Act]] redrew the boundaries of India's states along linguistic lines, and the predominantly [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking Amravati District was transferred to [[Bombay State]], which was renamed [[Maharashtra]] in 1960 when it was split from [[Gujarat]]...?

==Geography==
Achalpur and [[Paratwada]] are twin cities located in the lap of [[Satpura Range|Satpuda]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/16/Achalpur.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Achalpur, India|work=fallingrain.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an average elevation of 369&amp;nbsp;metres (1210&amp;nbsp;ft). These twin cities are surrounded by rivers named Sapan and Bicchhan, the tributaries of [[Chandrabhaga river (Amravati district)|Chandrabhaga river]]. There is hilly area that acts like a fence to this city. This city is at the boundary of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Even Madhya Pradesh is so close to this city that travelling of (about) 12&amp;nbsp;km changes the state region.

==Demographics==
As of census 2011 Achalpur and Paratwada Tehsil had a population of 6,12,293.
As of 2001 India [[census]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&amp;state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&amp;state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|work= |publisher= Census Commission of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achalpur &amp; Paratwada had a population of 107,304. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Achalpur has an average literacy rate of 88%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 54% of the males and 46% of females literate. 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==Transportation==
[[Achalpur railway station]] is the northern terminus of the 762&amp;nbsp;mm [[narrow gauge railway]] known locally as the Shakuntala railway. This line is composed of two legs intersecting with the [[Mumbai]]–[[Kolkata]] [[standard gauge]] railway at [[Murtuzapur]]&amp;nbsp;— the 76&amp;nbsp;km northern leg to Achalpur and the 113&amp;nbsp;km southeastern leg to [[Yavatmal]]. As of 2004 this line was still owned by a [[London]]-based company which had leased the line to India's [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]] since 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irfca.org/docs/rinbad-ng.html &quot;Indian Narrow-Gauge Lines 2002–2003&quot;]. Simon Mortimer. Indian Railways Fan Club. 13 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paratwada]] is well connected to major cities by state highways. Maharashtra Major State Highway 6 and Major State Highway 24 passes from [[Paratwada]]. Both public and private transport are popular in [[Paratwada]]. Private companies too run buses to major cities throughout India. Auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are allowed to operate in this city.
