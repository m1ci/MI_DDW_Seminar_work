[[File:Nanjo City Hall.jpg|thumb|Nanjō city hall]]

{{nihongo|'''Nanjō'''|南城市|Nanjō-shi|[[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: ''Nangushiku''}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in the southern part of [[Okinawa Island]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Translated literally, the name Nanjō means &quot;southern castle&quot;. Many castle ruins, called [[gusuku]] in the [[Okinawan language]], can be found throughout the city. The modern city of Nanjō was established on January 1, 2006, from the merger of the town of [[Sashiki, Okinawa|Sashiki]], and the villages of [[Chinen, Okinawa|Chinen]], [[Ōzato, Okinawa|Ōzato]] and [[Tamagusuku, Okinawa|Tamagusuku]] (all from [[Shimajiri District, Okinawa|Shimajiri District]]). Nanjō has an area of 49.69&amp;nbsp;km² and, on the date of its inception, a population of 41,305, and a density of 831.25 per km².&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot; /&gt;

Of the eleven cities in Okinawa Prefecture, Nanjō has the smallest population. It does not have a separate police station nor a high school. For those services, citizens have to refer to the neighbouring towns of [[Yonabaru]] and [[Yaese]]. The city hosts a fire station responsible for Chinen, Ōzato and Tamagusuku and parts of Yaese, while Sashiki is served by a separate station. The city's main economical activities are agriculture and tourism. Important crops include [[sugarcane]], for [[sugar]] and [[vinegar]] production, and [[turmeric]], a popular [[medicinal herb]] in Okinawa. Several turmeric processing plants are based in the city, producing semi-processed goods to be used by industries on the mainland or consumer products like [[tea]] and [[dietary supplements]].

==Tourism and Culture==
[[File:Sefautaki.jpg|thumb|Sefa-utaki]]

Located in Chinen, the [[seifa-utaki]] shrine is listed by [[UNESCO]] as part of the ''[[Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]]'' [[World Heritage Site]]. It was believed to be a sacred place, from where one could see the &quot;Isle of the Gods&quot;. In the shrine, ''[[Noro (priestess)|noro]]'' priestesses from [[Shuri Castle]] would pray for the well-being of the king and the kingdom.

In Tamagusuku, the Gyokusendō [[cave]] is known for its beautiful [[stalagmite]]s and [[stalactite]]s. Discovered in 1967, the cave is estimated to be at least five kilometers long, but only 890 metres are open to tourists. The cave is located inside the Okinawa World cultural [[theme park]]. Other attractions of the theme park are the [[Habu]] snake museum, native dances such as [[Eisa (dance)|Eisa]], and a traditional Ryūkyū-style village with traditional red-clay roofed houses and workshops for local crafts such as dying and weaving, pottery, and glass blowing.

Also located in Tamagusku, the Itokazu-Abuchiragama cave was used in [[World War II]] as a bomb shelter by soldiers and civilians alike. It is also open to tourists. [[Himeyuri Students]] were used as nurses in this location among others.

The isle of Kudaka, also called Isle of the Gods, can be accessed from Azama Port, located in Chinen.

From the isle of Ōjima, in Tamagusuku, one can board a glass-bottomed boat, a boat with a transparent floor used in marine-life observations.

As  [[golf]] is a popular sport in Okinawa, a famous site in Nanjō is the Ryūkyū Golf Club, with three 27-hole courses. Every spring, the Ryūkyū Golf Club welcomes the Daikin Orchid Ladies Golf Tournament.
