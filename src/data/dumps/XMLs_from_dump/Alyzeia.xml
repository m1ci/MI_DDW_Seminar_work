      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alyzeia''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλύζεια}})&lt;ref name=Stephanus&gt;{{Cite Stephanus|''s.v''}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Alyzia''' (Ἀλυζια),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Thucydides|7.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a town on the west coast of [[ancient Acarnania]].&lt;ref&gt;W.M. Murray, DARMC, R. Talbert, Brady Kiesling, Sean Gillies, Jeffrey Becker, and Tom Elliott, 'Alyz(e)ia: a Pleiades place resource', Pleiades: A Gazetteer of Past Places, 2019 &lt;https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/530793&gt; [accessed: 25 June 2019] &lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]] it was distant 15 [[stadion (unit)|stadia]] from the sea, on which it possessed a harbour and a sanctuary, both dedicated to [[Heracles]]. In this sanctuary were some works of art by [[Lysippus]], representing the [[Labours of Heracles]], which a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] general caused to be removed to Rome on account of the deserted state of the place. The remains of Alyzia are still visible in the valley of Kandili. The distance of the bay of Kandili from the ruins to [[Leucas (island)|Leucas]] corresponds with the 120 stadia which [[Cicero]] assigns for the distance between Alyzia and Leucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Strabo|pp. 450, 459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] ''ad Fam.'' 16.2; {{Cite Pliny|4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ptolemy|3.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alyzia is said to have derived its name from [[Alyzeus]], a son of [[Icarius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Strabo|p. 452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephanus/&gt; It is first mentioned by [[Thucydides]]; in 375&amp;nbsp;BCE, a naval battle was fought in the neighbourhood of Alyzia between the [[ancient Athens|Athenians]] under Timotheus and the [[ancient Sparta|Lacedaemonians]] under [[Nicolochus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Thucydides|7.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians, says [[Xenophon]], erected their trophy at Alyzia, and the Lacedaemonians in the nearest islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hellenica|5.4, 5.65-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; We learn from the ''[[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]'' that the island immediately opposite Alyzia was called Carnus, the modern [[Kalamos (island)|Kalamos]].

Its site is located near near the modern [[Kandila, Aetolia-Acarnania|Kandila]], Xiromero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Barrington|54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DARE|23292}}&lt;/ref&gt;
