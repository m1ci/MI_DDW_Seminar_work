''' øAmrƒÅn''' ({{lang-ar|ÿπŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÜ}}; [[Ancient South Arabian script|Old South Arabian]]: '''ê©≤ê©£ê©ßê©¨''' '' ømrn'') is a small city in western central [[Yemen]]. It is the capital of the [['Amran Governorate]], and was formerly in the [[Sana'a Governorate]]. It is located {{convert|52.9|km}} by road northwest of the Yemeni capital of [[Sana'a]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;&gt;{{cite map|title= Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2004 census it had a population of 76,863, and an estimated population of 90,792 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;lng=de&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=380398394&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=adhoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en|title=Amran|publisher=World Gazetteer|accessdate=13 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515215832/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=|archive-date=15 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and architecture==
[[File:Amran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Traditional mud-built house.]]
The founding of the town dates back to the era of the South Arabian [[Himyarite Kingdom]].  At the time of the Sabaean kingdom, the town blossomed into a fortress.  A series of [[Amran Tablets|bronze plaques]] from that time were found in the town in the mid-nineteenth century and are now in the [[British Museum]].  In particular, in the seventh century it was the great city of valour during the clashes against the Sabeans, a plurality of regionally based tribes.  Remains of carved stones that belonged to former temples and palaces bear witness today of past glory.  A large stone inscription is found in the western city gate (Bab al-Kabir).  The old [[souq]] is noted for its stone columns.&lt;ref name=&quot;H√§m√§l√§inen1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=H√§m√§l√§inen|first=Pertti|title=Yemen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCYuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=1 August 1999|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-0-86442-603-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   øAmram is completely surrounded by walls which date to 1720.  The surrounding landscape is dominated by terraced landscapes with stone walls to counteract erosion of fertile arable land.

==Economic development==
The road through the city from Sana'a was modernized following Chinese investment and is over {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} long, and the old medical centre has been transformed into a small public hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaughlin2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McLaughlin|first=Daniel|title=Yemen: The Bradt Travel Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=12 February 2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-212-5|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is located in a fertile area in what was the centre of the area's coffee industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullochHaskel1845&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCulloch|first1=John Ramsay|last2=Haskel|first2=Daniel|title=M'Culloch's Universal gazetteer: Dictionary, geographical, statistical, and historical, of the various countries, places, and principal natural objects in the world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfoRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=15 April 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1845|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|pages=93‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;
