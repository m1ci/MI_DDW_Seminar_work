== History ==
There were only several smaller [[shoal]]s in the area of present-day Yangzhong during the [[Eastern Jin]]. As time went on, they enlarged and merged into an elongated shoal by [[Tang dynasty]], which was called Xiaozhou ({{lang|zh|小洲}}; literally: &quot;Small shoal&quot;) in [[Song dynasty]]. It was renamed Xinzhou ({{lang|zh|新洲}}) and then Ximinzhou ({{lang|zh-hant|細民洲}}) during [[Ming dynasty]], and was designated Taipingzhou ({{lang|zh|太平洲}}) in [[Qing dynasty]].

In 1904, the imperial court decided to establish a [[subprefecture]] named after Taiping. In 1911, it was promoted to a county. Since there is a namesake in Anhui. The county was renamed Yangzhong, the abbreviation of &quot;{{lang|zh-hant|揚子江中}}&quot; which means &quot;(the shoal is) in the Yangtze River&quot;.
