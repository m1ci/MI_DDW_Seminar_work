It is located at a distance of 28&amp;nbsp;km from [[Jammu city|Jammu]], in the foothills of the Himalayas. The town is located on the banks of the [[Chenab River]]. The Akhnoor is divided into three Administrative Sub-Divisions - Akhnoor, [[Chowki Choura]] &amp; [[Khour, India|Khour]]; Seven Tehsils - Akhnoor Khaas, Chowki Choura, Maira Mandrian, Jourian, Kharah Balli, Khour &amp; Pargwal.

==History==

The place is believed to be the ancient city of ''Virat Nagar'' mentioned in the [[Mahabarata|Mahabharata]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akhnoor.nic.in/ Official Web Site of Akhnoor Sub-Division (J&amp;K)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/akhnoor-caught-in-a-time-warp/article5007275.ece Akhnoor: Caught in a time warp - The Hindu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[Viratnagar|Bairat]], a town in northern [[Jaipur district]] of Rajasthan is more established as the ancient ''Virat Nagar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/exclusive_arch.asp?ex_id=1968&amp;ex_title=A+Tryst+with+History+at+Viratnagar+ A Tryst with History at Viratnagar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kapasanmata.com/History.aspx Kapasan Mata&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The place is one of the most important historical sites in Jammu and Kashmir. Excavations by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] have established the fact that Akhnoor was one of the last bastion of the [[Harappan Civilization]] and Manda, Akhnoor is the northern most site of the Harappan Civilisation. [[Terracotta]] figures and other anthropological objects belonging to the [[Harappan Civilization#Collapse and Late Harappan|later Harappan]] period have been found during the excavations. Beyond Akhnoor, towards the upper hilly area that joins [[Sivalik Hills]], there has been no trace of any object that could show that Harappans moved any further beyond this town.

Excavations at Ambaran-Pamberwan sites have proved that the place was a prominent abode of [[Buddhism]] during the [[Kushan Empire|
Kushan]] period and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period. Apart from an ancient an eight-spoke [[Stupa]] (a mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics, made of high quality baked bricks and surrounded by stone pathways, meditation cells and rooms),&lt;ref&gt;[http://hillpost.in/2011/11/dalai-lama-to-visit-kushan-period-monastry-excavated-in-kashmir/34832/ Dalai Lama to visit Kushan period monastry &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; excavated in Kashmir | Hill Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; life sized Terracotta busts of [[Buddha]] and coins belonging to those periods were also excavated from the sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.oneindia.in/2011/10/17/dalai-lama-to-visit-ambaran-next-month.html Dalai Lama to visit Ambaran next month - News Oneindia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[14th Dalai Lama]] visited the place in August, 2012. Buddhist relics from the Pre-Kushan reign and silver caskets, gold and silver leaves, pearls, corals and three copper coins from the Gupta period are reported to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://himsatta.com/fullstory.php?&amp;id=6&amp;newsid=1331 Dalai Lama Visits Ancient Buddhist Sites in Jammu : Himsatta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenorthlines.com/newsdet.aspx?q=41918 |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308054924/http://www.thenorthlines.com/newsdet.aspx?q=41918 |archive-date=8 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the Stupas is such that it lies on the ancient routes from [[Pataliputra]], in present-day [[Patna]], [[Bihar]], in India to [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]] now in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] Province, [[Pakistan]].

Among other find of historical importance that indicates the place inhabited by people pre-dominantly belonging to [[Hinduism]] is the green coloured [[Trimurti]] idol made up of a single stone at Ambarran Village.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Etymology==
The town is believed to have been named Akhnoor by Mughal Emperor Jahangir who once visited the area and the fort on the advice of a saint when his eyes got infected while returning from Kashmir. Amazingly, Jahangir's eyes were fully cured by the fresh air of the town blowing over the Chenab. He called the town ''Aankho-ka-Noor'' (light of the eyes) and since then the place came to be known ''Akhnoor''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99sep04/saturday/head13.htm The Tribune...Saturday Plus Head&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
However a contrasting narrative as copied from the official site of Akhnoor goes like this:

{{cquote|... it came to be known as Akhnoor during the Mughal reign. The reason behind this is that the Mughal emperor's wife had vision problem in her eyes and she was prescribed to wash her eyes with the holy water of Chenab using some [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]] medicines by a local Hindu priest. The queen strictly followed the prescription and her vision was restored. Hence the city was named Akhnoor as in [[Urdu]] the word 'noor' means vision/glow/shine and the word 'aankh' means the eye.|source=Akhnoor Sub-Division Administration&lt;ref&gt;[http://akhnoor.nic.in/AkhnoorDetails/tourism.htm Akhnoor Tourism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
