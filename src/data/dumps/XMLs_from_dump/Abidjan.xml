'''Abidjan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|b|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|ɑː|n}} {{respell|AB|ih|JAHN}}, {{IPA-fr|abidʒɑ̃|lang}}) is the economic capital of [[Ivory Coast]] and one of the most populous French-speaking cities in [[Africa]]. According to the 2014 census, Abidjan's population was 4.7 million, which is 20 percent of the overall population of the country, and this also makes it the sixth most populous city proper in [[Africa]], after [[Lagos]], [[Cairo]], [[Kinshasa]], [[Dar es Salaam]], and [[Johannesburg]]. A cultural crossroads of West Africa, Abidjan is characterised by a high level of industrialisation and urbanisation.

The city expanded quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933. Abidjan remained the capital of Côte d'Ivoire after its independence from France in 1960. The completion of the [[Vridi Canal]] in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important [[sea port]]. In 1983, the city of [[Yamoussoukro]] was designated as the official political capital of Côte d'Ivoire. However, almost all political institutions and foreign [[embassy|embassies]] continue to be located in Abidjan.

Because Abidjan is also the largest city in the country and the centre of its economic activity, it has officially been designated as the &quot;economic capital&quot; of the country. The [[Abidjan Autonomous District]], which encompasses the city and some of its suburbs, is one of the 14 [[districts of Côte d'Ivoire]].

== Geography ==
[[File:CarteSituationAbidjan.svg|thumb|Location map of Abidjan]]
Abidjan lies on the south-east coast of the country, on the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The city is located on the [[Ébrié Lagoon]]. The business district, [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]], is the center of the city, along with [[Cocody]], [[Deux Plateaux]] (the city's wealthiest neighborhood and a hub for diplomats), and  [[Adjamé]], a [[slum]] on the north shore of the lagoon. [[Treichville]] and [[Marcory]] lie to the south, [[Attecoube]], [[Locodjro]], [[Abobo Doume]] and [[Yopougon]] to the west, and  [[Île Boulay]] is located in the middle of the lagoon. Further south lies [[Port Bouët]], home to the [[Port Bouet Airport|airport]] and main [[seaport]]. Abidjan is located at 5°25′ North, 4°2′ West (5.41667, −4.03333).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |title=GNS: Country Files |publisher=Earth-info.nga.mil |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509082929/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |archivedate=9 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
Abidjan experiences a [[tropical wet and dry climate]], according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Aw'''). Abidjan has nonconsecutive rainy seasons (precipitation above {{convert|60|mm}} with a long rainy season from March to July and a short rainy season from September to December, and three dry months (January, February and August). Precipitation is abundant during the summer months, except for August, due to activation of the [[Benguela Current]], which reduces the precipitation total throughout the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/atlantic/benguela.html| title = The Benguela Current| publisher = Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) and Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbons in the Environment (CARTHE)| accessdate = 8 November 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160507192952/http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/atlantic/benguela.html| archive-date = 7 May 2016| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Benguela Current also lowers the mean temperature during August, making it the coolest month of the year, averaging {{convert|24.5|C}}. Abidjan has two additional dry months (January and February). Abidjan is generally humid, with average relative humidity above 80% throughout the year.

=== Territorial divisions ===
Abidjan is composed of northern Abidjan and southern Abidjan. Each has ten formal boroughs, or communes, each being run by a mayor.&lt;!-- except we only list six each here? --&gt;

==== Communes of Northern Abidjan ====
[[File:Abidjan&amp;#039;s plateau district view.jpg|thumb|A view of the Plateau district in Abidjan]]
*'''[[Abobo]]''' consists mainly of public housing. Abobo has a large population of low-income migrants. This area has developed spontaneously.
*'''[[Adjamé]]''' developed from the village of Ébrié, which existed before Abidjan developed. Although polluted and small in size, this commune is commercially very important for the Ivorian economy. It contains a varied shopping district and its bus station is the Côte d'Ivoire's main hub for international bus lines.
*'''[[Yopougon]]''' is the most populous commune of Abidjan, lying partly in Northern Abidjan and partly across the lagoon in Southern Abidjan. It is home to both industrial and residential areas. The research station [[ORSTOM]], the [[Pasteur Institute]], and a training hospital are located in this commune.
*'''[[Plateau, Côte d'Ivoire|Plateau]]''' is Ivory Coast's business center, with very modern, tall buildings. Although the governmental and administrative capital of Côte d'Ivoire officially transferred to [[Yamoussoukro]] in 1983, the institutions of the republic such as the Presidency and National Assembly are still located in Plateau. It is the main administrative, commercial and financial center of Ivory Coast.
*'''[[Attécoubé]]''' contains [[Banco National Park|Banco]] forest, classified as a national park.
*'''[[Cocody]]''' is famous for its residential districts, Deux-Plateaux and Riviera. The [[Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], a public institution, and some private universities are also located within the commune. [[Radio Television Ivoirienne (RTI)]] is located in Cocody. The President of the Republic also resides in this commune, which contains the embassy district.

==== Communes of Southern Abidjan ====
[[File:Vridi1.jpg|thumb|Beach of Vridi|upright]]

*'''[[Koumassi]]''': This commune has an important industrial area.
*'''[[Marcory]]''': This commune is mainly residential, and contains the upscale {{Interlanguage link multi|Biétry|fr}} and [[:fr:Zone 4|Zone 4]] neighborhoods where many foreigners live.
*'''[[Port-Bouët]]''': This commune includes the ([[:fr:Société Ivoirienne de Raffinage|SIR]] refinery and the Félix Houphouët-Boigny International [[Port Bouet Airport|airport]]. There is also an established office of the [[Institut de Recherche pour le Développement|IRD]], the centre of Little Bassam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ird.ci/ird/petitbassam.html |title=Centre des Sciences Sociales |website=[[Institut de recherche pour le développement|IRD]] |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207201015/http://www.ird.ci/ird/petitbassam.html |archivedate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[lighthouse]] sweeps the [[Gulf of Guinea]] for several nautical miles out. The [[Vridi]] beach area is busy every weekend although the ocean is very rough; this phenomenon widely holds all along the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. From 1950 on, Vridi has been the primary employment hub in Abidjan because of its increasing number of factories and warehouses.
*'''[[Treichville]]''': This commune is home to the [[Autonomous Port of Abidjan]] and to many stores. The port area is also industrial. There is also the Treichville state swimming pool (PET),&lt;!-- &quot;piscine d'état de&quot; ? --&gt; the Treichville sports palace, the [[Palace of Culture of Abidjan|Palace of Culture]], and the Abidjan [[racetrack]].
** [[Île Boulay]].

==== Suburbs ====
Towns near Abidjan include [[Jacqueville]], [[Grand-Lahou]] and [[Dabou]] in the west; [[Sikensi]], [[Tiassalé]], [[Agboville]], [[Adzopé]] and [[Alépé]] in the north; and [[Grand-Bassam]] to the east.

The towns (or [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]]) of [[Anyama]], [[Bingerville]], [[Brofodoumé]] and [[Songon]] are within the [[Abidjan Department]], which is co-extensive with the autonomous district.

== &lt;span id=Toponymy&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Etymology ==
According to [[oral tradition]] of the [[Tchaman]] as reported in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Côte d'Ivoire,&lt;ref&gt;de R. Borremans (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; the name &quot;Abidjan&quot; results from a misunderstanding. Legend states that an old man carrying branches to repair the roof of his house met a European explorer who asked him the name of the nearest village. The old man did not speak the language of the explorer, and thought that he was being asked to justify his presence in that place. Terrified by this unexpected meeting, he fled shouting &quot;''min-chan m'bidjan''&quot;, which means in the Ébrié language: &quot;I just cut the leaves.&quot; The explorer, thinking that his question had been answered, recorded the name of the locale as ''Abidjan''.

A slightly different and less elaborate version of the legend: When the first colonists asked a native man the name of the place, the man misunderstood and replied &quot;''M'bi min djan''&quot;: &quot;I've just been cutting leaves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;statoids1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statoids.com/uci.html |title=Côte d'Ivoire Regions |publisher=Statoids.com |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427104110/http://www.statoids.com/uci.html |archive-date=27 April 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Abidjan}}

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:Piroguiers - cleaned b&amp;w.jpg|thumb|Abidjan boatmen.]]

Abidjan was originally a small [[Tchaman|Atchan]] fishing village. In 1896, following a series of deadly [[yellow fever]] [[epidemics]], French [[colonist]]s who had initially settled in [[Grand-Bassam]] decided to move to a safer place and in 1898 chose the current location of Abidjan.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Abidjan Abidjan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710090607/https://www.britannica.com/place/Abidjan |date=10 July 2019 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1903 it officially became a town.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril K. Daddieh, ''Historical Dictionary of Cote d'Ivoire (The Ivory Coast)'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abidjan |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32 32] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers were followed by the colonial government, created in 1899. But then nearby [[Bingerville]] became the capital of the French [[colony]], from 1900 until 1934.

The future Abidjan, situated on the edge of the ''lagoon n'doupé'' (&quot;the lagoon in hot water&quot;), offered more land and greater opportunities for trade expansion. The wharf in Petit Bassam (now [[Port-Bouet]]) south of town quickly overtook the wharf of [[Grand-Bassam]] in importance, and became the main point of economic access to the colony. In 1904, the rail terminus was located in the [[Port-Bouet]] area of Abidjan.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Starting in 1904, when [[Bingerville]] was not yet complete, Abidjan became the main economic hub of the colony of Ivory Coast and a prime channel for distributing products to the European [[hinterland]], particularly through the Lebanese community, which was increasing in importance.

{{Interlanguage link multi|Henri de Fougères|fr|3=Henri Terrasson de Fougères}} became governor of [[French Sudan]] in 1924, and remained governor until his death in 1931. One of the main streets of Abidjan still bears his name.

In 1931, Plateau and what would become [[Treichville]] were connected by a floating bridge, more or less where the [[Houphouët-Boigny Bridge]] stands today. The year 1931 also saw [[Address (geography)|addresses]] begin to be assigned to the streets of Abidjan for the first time. The addressing project was temporarily concluded in 1964, under the leadership of Mayor Konan Kanga, then badly redone American-style in 1993.

Abidjan became the third capital of Ivory Coast by a 1934 decree, following [[Grand-Bassam]] and [[Bingerville]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Several villages in Tchaman were then deserted. The leader of the Tchaman community can still be found in Adjame (&quot;center&quot; or &quot;meeting&quot; in Tchaman), north of the Plateau.

South of the Plateau district (the current central district of the city of Abidjan), the village of ''Dugbeo'' was moved across the lagoon to Anoumabo, &quot;the forest of fruit bats&quot;, which became the neighborhood of [[Treichville]] (now known as Commikro, city of clerks). Treichville was renamed in 1934, in honour of [[Marcel Treich-Laplénie]] (1860–1890), the first explorer of the Ivory Coast and its first colonial administrator, considered its founder. Instead of Dugbeyo, is the current Treich-Laplénie Avenue, the bus station and water lagoon buses in Plateau, and the Avenue [[Charles de Gaulle]] (commonly called Rue du Commerce).

The city was laid out like most colonial towns, on a [[grid plan]]. [[Plateau, Côte d'Ivoire|Le Plateau]] (&quot;m'brato&quot; in Tchaman) were inhabited by settlers. In the north, the city was inhabited by the colonized. The two zones were separated by the [[Gallieni]] Military Barracks, where now there is the current courthouse.

Near the port, originally named Boulevard de Marseille, settlers became defensive and stole a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebière, a sand track. This is the legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in [[Cocody]] and a racetrack was built in the south of the city.

In Le Plateau in the 1940s, the Bardon Park Hotel was built, the first air-conditioned hotel working in [[francophone Africa]].

Abidjan's lagoon became connected to the sea once the 15m-deep {{Interlanguage link multi|Vridi|fr}} canal was completed in 1950.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Soon Abidjan became the financial center of West Africa. In 1958, the first bridge to connect [[Petit Bassam|Petit-Bassam Island]] with the mainland was completed.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

=== After independence ===
When Côte d’Ivoire became independent in 1960, Abidjan became the new country's administrative and economic center. The axis south of Treichville, towards the international airport and the beaches, became the heart of European and middle-class Abidjan. The city saw considerable population growth in the decades following independence, expanding from 180,000 inhabitants in 1960 to 1,269,000 in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/abidjan-cote-divoire-1903|title=Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (1903-    ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202035609/http://www.blackpast.org/gah/abidjan-cote-divoire-1903|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abidjan's skyline dates back to the economic prosperity of this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/CIV_Port_of_Abidjan_1422.php|title=Port of Abidjan|website=World Port Source|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605071256/http://worldportsource.com/ports/review/CIV_Port_of_Abidjan_1422.php|archive-date=5 June 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New districts such as the upmarket Cocody were founded during this period; built to a large extent in a colonial style, Cocody has since become home to Côte d’Ivoire's wealthy classes as well as expatriates and foreign diplomats. The district is home to the embassy of France, Hotel Ivoire (which for a long time, was the only African hotel to have a skating rink), and, since 2009, the largest U.S. embassy in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-07-12-voa68-66931712/264223.html|title=Massive New US Embassy Opens in Ivory Coast|newspaper=VOA|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202040418/http://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-07-12-voa68-66931712/264223.html|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on St. Paul's Cathedral, designed by Italian architect Aldo Spirito, began with the 1980 groundbreaking by Pope John Paul II and was completed in 1985. From the 1980s, Abidjan's fortunes declined as a result of negligence on the part of officials as well as corruption and general degradation. In 1983, the village of Yamoussoukro became the new political capital of Ivory Coast under the leadership of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who was born in Yamoussoukro.

From 2002 to 2007 and especially from 2010 to 2011, Abidjan suffered from the consequences of the First and Second Ivorian Civil Wars. In November 2004, armed conflict broke out between French forces and Ivorian forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo after the Ivorian Air Force attacked French peacekeepers in northern Côte d’Ivoire. After France destroyed Côte d’Ivoire's air capabilities in retaliation, pro-Gbagbo groups staged riots and looting in Abidjan and targeted French homes, schools, and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/ivory-coast-2004.htm|title=Ivory Coast Conflict - 2004|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202042128/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/ivory-coast-2004.htm|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; French peacekeepers moved into the city to calm the situation.

Côte d’Ivoire's civil conflicts seriously impacted the security situation in Abidjan. Amidst the anti-French riots in November 2004, 4,000 prisoners in Abidjan escaped from the country's largest prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/12/world/africa/ivory-coast-says-4000-prison-inmates-escaped.html|title=Ivory Coast Says 4,000 Prison Inmates Escaped|last=The Associated Press|date=2004-11-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064531/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/12/world/africa/ivory-coast-says-4000-prison-inmates-escaped.html|archive-date=18 September 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abidjan was one of the main theaters of the 2010-2011 Ivorian crisis and the site of major demonstrations against incumbent president Gbagbo, including one on International Women's Day in 2011 that saw several demonstrators killed by Gbagbo's forces. The end of the crisis came with Gbagbo's capture in Abidjan in April 2011, following a major offensive by forces loyal to election winner Alassane Ouattara with support from France and the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ivory-coast-strongman-laurent-gbagbo-arrested/|title=Ivory Coast strongman Laurent Gbagbo arrested|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202101406/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ivory-coast-strongman-laurent-gbagbo-arrested/|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
=== Administration ===

==== Organisation ====
Formerly managed by the French colonial administration, Abidjan became a municipality in 1956, divided into administrative areas by lagoons. Its first municipal council was elected on 18 November 1956, and the first mayor in the context of the Loi-Cadre of 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loi n°56-619 du 23 juin 1956: MESURES PROPRES A ASSURER L'EVOLUTION DES TERRITOIRES RELEVANT DU MINISTERE DE LA FRANCE D'OUTRE-MER |url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000692222 |access-date=2 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308010331/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000692222 |archive-date=8 March 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; was president [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]. A 1978 law created twenty-seven municipalities in the country. After the application of this new organization, Dioulo Emmanuel was elected mayor of Abidjan on 30 November 1980.

Since 2001, the city has been divided into ten boroughs (communes). In 2011, the autonomous district of Abidjan was established by a decree instituting a system based on districts and regions instead.&lt;ref&gt;Décret n° 2011-263 du 28 septembre 2011 portant organisation du territoire national en Districts et en Régions.&lt;/ref&gt; with rural sub-prefectures in [[Anyama]], [[Bingerville]], [[Brofodoumé]], and [[Songon]]. The autonomous district overlaps the [[Abidjan Department]], which was established in 1969 and has had its current boundaries since 1998. In 2011, the post of Mayor of Abidjan was replaced by that of District Governor, appointed by the head of state. The position has been occupied by [[Robert Beugré Mambé]] since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abidjan.district.ci/index2.php?page=gou |title=Anciens Maires et Gouverneurs |trans-title=Former Mayors and Governors |publisher=Abidjan |access-date=2 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412183502/http://www.abidjan.district.ci/index2.php?page=gou |archive-date=12 April 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the ten communes of Abidjan has its own municipal council, headed by a mayor. The last municipal elections were held in March 2001. The sub-prefectures of the autonomous district also have their own mayors and councils.

The communes of Abobo, Adjamé, Attécoubé, Cocody, and Plateau are located north of the Ébrié Lagoon (hence the name &quot;Abidjan North&quot;). This is the continental part of Abidjan.
The commune of Yopougon straddles the lagoon, with part lying north and part south of that body of water. The communes of [[Treichville]], [[Koumassi]], [[Marcory]], and [[Port-Bouet]] in Abidjan are south of the lagoon. [[Blokosso]] and [[Locodjro]] villages are included within the city and maintain cultural identity in urban areas.

== Education ==
The [[Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] was founded in 1964.

In Côte d'Ivoire, the enrollment rate is 74%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/livre244/l24424.pdf |title=La Scolarisation en Côte d'Ivoire |first=Noël Kouassi |last=Ayewa |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625164113/http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/livre244/l24424.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to secondary education is limited by an entrance assessment at the 6th stage after which one-third of students are allowed to continue their studies. 24% of the student population resides in Abidjan, which comprises 20% of the total population. Abidjan is the location of the main educational institutions in the Côte d'Ivoire. These include the Lycée Classique d'Abidjan, the Lycée Sainte-Marie de Cocody, Lycée garçon de Bingerville, Mami Adjoua the Lyceum, the Blaise Pascal Abidjan school is a French school – a school who has signed an agreement with the ADFE. Recently the Lycée International Jean-Mermoz re-opened which was initially called College International Jean-Mermoz, founded by Pierre Padovani. The Institution suffered from a devastating war and was forced to close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adfe.org |title=Site de l'ADFE |publisher=Adfe.org |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513033103/http://adfe.org/ |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government institutions ==
[[File:Asnat codivoire.jpg|thumb|Seat of the [[National Assembly of Cote d'Ivoire]]]]

The majority of Ivorian government institutions are still located in Abidjan and have not been transferred to the political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]]. The President's office is in [[Cocody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.présidence.ci Le site officiel de la présidence de Côte d'Ivoire]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.premierministre.ci Site officiel de la Primature de la République ivoirienne] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609104659/http://www.premierministre.ci/ |date=9 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Constitutional Council (Côte d'Ivoire)|Constitutional Council]], the Supreme Court, and the Chancellery of the National Order are all in [[Plateau, Côte d'Ivoire|Le Plateau]].

Government offices are located in Le Plateau&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.gouv.ci Portail officiel du gouvernement ivoirien] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611065145/http://www.gouv.ci/ |date=11 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the administrative district of Abidjan, Boulevard Carde or Angoulvant Boulevard (near the Cathedral of St. Paul of Abidjan), or elsewhere in the great buildings of the town.

== Security ==
The instability of the 2002-2007 civil war and 2010-2011 crisis saw foreign peacekeeping forces stationed in Abidjan. The United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire ([[United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire|UNOCI]]), established in April 2004, has its headquarters at the former Hotel Sebroko in Attécoubé. While the size of the force has been reduced since the end of the 2011 crisis, UNOCI's mandate was extended in 2013 and again in 2015. The force remains authorized to maintain up to 5,245 troops, 192 observers, 1,500 police and eight customs officers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unoci/background.shtml|title=UNOCI Background - United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708043957/http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unoci/background.shtml|archive-date=8 July 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's peacekeeping operations in Côte d’Ivoire continued under the aegis of Operation Unicorn until 2015 and then as the French forces in Côte d’Ivoire from 2015 onward. In 2014, French defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that Abidjan would be reinforced as the entry point for France's military presence and counterterrorism operations in the Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/france-to-create-new-africa-outposts-to-better-fight-terrorism-1.1649084|title=France to create new Africa outposts to better fight terrorism|last=Keaten|first=Jamey|newspaper=CTVNews|language=en-CA|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202171658/http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/france-to-create-new-africa-outposts-to-better-fight-terrorism-1.1649084|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After al-Qaeda militants targeted beachgoers at Grand Bassam in March 2016, the French government announced it would increase its troop deployment in Côte d’Ivoire from 500 to 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-04-30-france-says-it-will-increase-forces-in-ivory-coast-as-region-faces-growing-islamist-threat|title=France says it will increase forces in Côte d'Ivoire, as region faces growing Islamist threat|date=2016-04-30|newspaper=MG Africa|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202040140/http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-04-30-france-says-it-will-increase-forces-in-ivory-coast-as-region-faces-growing-islamist-threat|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; French soldiers are based in Port-Bouet as well as at the Abidjan airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/forces-prepositionnees/cote-d-ivoire/dossier/les-forces-francaises-en-cote-d-ivoire|title=Les forces françaises en Côte d'Ivoire|website=www.defense.gouv.fr|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202035643/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/forces-prepositionnees/cote-d-ivoire/dossier/les-forces-francaises-en-cote-d-ivoire|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Pierre Laba's comedy film ''Permanent Danger'' explored the laxity of the police against banditry in major African cities, specifically in Abidjan.

=== Police ===
Abidjan is divided into districts, each of which has a police station. The municipal police and national police are separate.

All police are trained at the National Police Academy in the town of Cocody. They are recruited by competitive examination held by the police administration. The police include several sections, such as the BAE (Anti Riot Squad), whose base is located in Yopougon north of the city, the CRS (Republican Security Company), whose main base is located in Williamsville (Adjame) and also includes a secondary base called CRS2, which is located in zone 4 in the town of [[Marcory]] in the central capital. The Force{{who|date=October 2016}} and CECOS accompany the police.

The main base of the gendarmerie is at Agban (commonly Adjamé). There are others in [[Abobo]] and [[Kumasi]], It also has a training school in Cocody and the city{{clarify|date=October 2016}}.

=== Drugs ===
Since 2000, Côte d'Ivoire has experienced a sharp rise in drug trafficking. Drug dens arise mainly in informal settlements and there has been a recent spike in demand among unemployed youth and Ivorian vagrants. The Ivorian police increasingly focus on the fight against trafficking and drug use in the district of Abidjan. A report by the Office of the UN says West Africa plays an increasingly important role in the transit of cocaine to Latin America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== French military base ===
Abidjan is home to [[Port-Bouet]], one of the six French military bases that still exist in Africa ([[Dakar]], [[Libreville]], [[Bouar]] CAR, [[N'Djamena]] and [[Djibouti]]). Thousands of people live there, around the 43rd BIMA which is permanently in place in accordance with established defense agreements on 24 April 1961 linking the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;

== Society ==
The 1998 census recorded Abidjan's population as 2,877,923. Estimates for the population of the Abidjan metropolitan area {{As of|2005|lc=on}} vary between 4 and 5 million inhabitants. As Abidjan is inhabited by people from a wide array of different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]], French is commonly spoken in the [[metropolitan area]], which is the fourth largest French speaking metropolitan area in the world after [[Paris]], [[Montreal]] and [[Kinshasa]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reference needed. An authoritative reference is needed so that the relative sizes of these Francophone cities is acknowledged in the different articles|date=June 2009}} Colloquial Abidjan French has even appeared, which has a different pronunciation and some familiar words from standard French.

=== Demographics ===
The population of Abidjan was 4,707,404 at the 2014 census. In 2006, the metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase can be attributed to the displacement since September 2002 caused by the war. Many inhabitants come to live in town for employment and safer housing.

By 1950, Abidjan had just exceeded a population of 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million by the end of 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year, doubling every six or seven years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3–6%. Birth rate growth was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals. The migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within Côte d'Ivoire, and about 30,000 from abroad per Côte d'Ivoireyear. From within Côte d'Ivoire, the migration pattern was dominated by [[Akan people|Akan]] (South-east, 48%), then [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] (North-west, 24%) and [[Krumen people|Krou]] (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was [[Burkina Faso|Burkinabes]] (30%), [[Mali]]ans (22%), [[Ghana]]ians (19%), [[Niger]]ien (11%), and [[Guinea]]ns (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/education/ACTES/Com_Zanou.PDF |title=Strategies Educatives En Milieu Emigre De La Cote-D'Ivoire |accessdate=9 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727150448/http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/education/ACTES/Com_Zanou.PDF |archive-date=27 July 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the non-African migration, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] migration was highest, followed by European migration, with the French being largest of this latter group. All in all, people of non-African origin represent 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which remains the highest in the region.

The figures for 2006 estimated the population of Abidjan to 3,796,677 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase is mainly due to war events of September 2002. The town hosts many people in search of both jobs and secure homes.

Before 2014, the last population census in the country had taken place in 1998. It presented 2,877,948 inhabitants for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056 |title=La Ville d'Abidjan: Population |website=Digital Afrique |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928162745/http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056 |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new census was held in May 2014 and showed a population for the city of 4,707,404.

=== Languages ===
The traditional language of the city was [[Ebrié language|Ebrié]]. Since independence, the [[official language]] in Abidjan and throughout Côte d'Ivoire has been French. While the official language is a formal variety standard French similar to that of Paris, the most commonly spoken form of [[African French#Abidjan French vocabulary|French in Abidjan]] is a colloquial dialect known as ''français de Treichville'' or ''français de Moussa'' which differs from standard French in pronunciation and in some of its vocabulary. Another form of spoken French in Abidjan is ''[[Nouchi]]'', a highly informal variety used as adolescent slang. The historical lingua franca, still spoken and understood by most of the trading population of Abidjan, is [[Dioula language|Dioula]]. The city hosts many Ivorians from all over the country and about sixty vernacular languages are spoken, such as [[Attié language|Attié]], [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]], [[Bété language|Bété]], and [[Wobé language|Wobé]]. Abidjan is surrounded by more than thirty villages where Baoulé and Ébrié are still commonly spoken.

=== Health ===
Some traditional medicine establishments sell traditional drugs in the street.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} There are numerous health centers, pharmacies and pharmacopoeias.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The city has more than fifty clinics, and over sixty specialist locations ([[veterinary]], [[dermatology]], [[Dentistry|dental]], [[optometry]], motherhood, [[psychology]], [[pediatrics]], etc.){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

=== Urbanism and habitat ===
Modern districts like [[Le Plateau, Abidjan|Plateau]] or [[Cocody]] have developed similar to those in Europe with the construction of large office towers and apartment buildings between the 1970s and the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/fr/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100024&amp;bt=5&amp;ht=2&amp;sro=0 |title=Abidjan – Immeubles de grandes hauteurs existant |publisher=Emporis |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190249/http://www.emporis.com/fr/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100024&amp;bt=5&amp;ht=2&amp;sro=0 |archive-date=29 June 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional neighborhoods like [[Treichville]] or [[Marcory]] maintained the system of &quot;concessions&quot; where housing is adjacent to the plant and an area of several houses, within the normal organization and multi centuries-old African villages.&lt;ref&gt;Haeringer Ph., Vingt-cinq ans de politique urbaine à Abidjan ou la tentation de l'urbanisme intégral, Politique Africaine, n°17, 20–40, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The district of [[Cocody]] is also home to many single-storey wooden villas, surrounded by vast gardens of lush vegetation, fed by the heavy rains that water the city. Wealthier inhabitants constructed villas in imitation of Greek temples in this district. In addition, many houses were built on stilts on the edge of the [[Ébrié Lagoon]]. The town hall, a fine example of [[modernist]] architecture, was designed by architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri Chomette(architect)|fr|3=Henri Chomette (architecte)|lt=Henri Chomette}}.

==== Problems with urban network ====
[[File:Abidjan-Plateau1.JPG|thumb|Urban Network in Le Plateau]]

The urban network is disrupted, as Abidjan has seen its population double every seven years since 1945. Rural people are attracted by the opportunities of the city. Abidjan represents 45% of city dwellers in the Côte d'Ivoire and 20% of the overall population. The city is by far the country's largest, dwarfing the second-largest city, [[Bouaké]] (which had 542,082 inhabitants in 2014) as well as the political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]] (207,412 inhabitants).

==== Urban squalor ====

Since the [[2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump|2006 Probo Koala toxic waste dumping incident]],&lt;ref&gt;Probo-Koala : la mortelle errance d'un bateau-poubelle, ''Le Monde'', 29 septembre 2006&lt;/ref&gt; significant efforts have been made to address waste management issues in Abidjan. In 2006, a contract was signed between [[China]] and Côte d'Ivoire: a Chinese company handling urban waste and industrial plans to treat all waste district this transformation also create daily cleaning. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abidjan.net/videos/video_wm.asp?n=4467&amp;cat=pol |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210206/http://news.abidjan.net/videos/video_wm.asp?n=4467&amp;cat=pol |title=Salubrité urbaine : Signature d’un accord entre la chine et le District d’Abidjan |website=Abidjan.net |language=French |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French nongovernmental organisation ACTED rolled out a three-part project across three districts of Abidjan in 2016, establishing street cleaning, waste collection and hygiene training. ACTED spokesperson Jérémy Lescot described the project as &quot;a fine success&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ready-for-the-resource-revolution.com/en/acted-sustainable-access-to-sanitation-in-ivory-coast/ |title=&quot;ACTED: sustainable access to sanitation in Ivory Coast&quot; |website=Ready for the Rescue |accessdate=28 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707133812/http://www.ready-for-the-resource-revolution.com/en/acted-sustainable-access-to-sanitation-in-ivory-coast/ |archive-date=7 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Urban rehabilitation ====
The last transportation upgrade in Abidjan led to the repaving of certain roads in the capital in 1994. Since May 2007, the company {{Interlanguage link multi|Ageroute|fr}} (Road Management Agency) is undertaking major operations in Abidjan and [[Anyama]] relating to badly damaged roads, suffering from lack of maintenance, heavy rain and protests. It is also addressing the gutters and unpaved roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaf.org/fr/pays/fiche.php?itm=2124&amp;md=&amp;thm=&amp;p=16 |title=Article du Matin d'Abidjan

&lt;/ref&gt; The District and BNETD plan to rehabilitate and construct {{convert|400|to(-)|500|mi|km|abbr=off}}, providing them with a quality to last 15–20 years of life. Improvements include the rehabilitation of roads in Abidjan and [[Anyama]], construction of drains, the tarring of gravel roads and sanitation of the city by the construction of sewers. These rehabilitations affect all municipalities in Abidjan:

* In [[Cocody]], at a cost of 3&amp;nbsp;billion [[CFA franc]], reconstruction of the [[Corniche]], one of the busiest roads in the municipality. Reconstruction has been extended by the dam of the limit, located at the ''Carrefour de la vie'', to filter all waste dumped into the lagoon.
* At [[Yopougon]], the rehabilitation nerve Sand continues with the construction of a culvert {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=off}} long designed to slow the streaking wastewater, the main cause of the degradation of pathways.
* In [[Abobo]] the degradation of the roads requires a significant investment in manufacturing and installation of gutters to ensure proper sanitation. The rehabilitation of roads and highways continues.

== Industry ==
The region near the lagoons is the most industrialized region of the country.

Major industries include [[food processing]], [[lumber]], automobile manufacturing, textiles, [[chemical industry|chemicals]], and [[soap]]. There is also a large [[oil refinery]]. Its industries are mainly in construction and maintenance with the presence of major international groups: the furnace SETAO, Colas, [[Bouygues]], [[Jean Lefebvre]], and Swiss [[Holcim]].

There are textile industries with the packaging of cotton in the north both for export or for on-site processing of cloth, canvas, batik clothing and miscellaneous. The textile sector is very dynamic, and represents 15.6% of net investment, 13% of turnover and 24% of the value added in Ivorian industry.

There are several offshore oil wells in operation (Côte d'Ivoire is an oil producing country), which leads to the presence of a chemical industry with oil refineries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbendi.co.za/french/RESI.HTM |title=Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (SIR) – Simple Oil Refinery in Vridi, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire |publisher=Mbendi.co.za |accessdate=9 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620001603/http://www.mbendi.co.za/french/RESI.HTM |archive-date=20 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an oil port. It also works on stones and precious metals for exportation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.notre-planete.info/actualites/actu_1209_moratoire_interdiction_commerce_ivoire.php |title=Interdiction du commerce international de l'ivoire |publisher=Notre-planete.info |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225811/http://www.notre-planete.info/actualites/actu_1209_moratoire_interdiction_commerce_ivoire.php |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also has a large wood processing plant at the port by river from the forests of central [[Canada]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}}. It exports natural [[mahogany]], peeled wood, [[plywood]] and [[Paperboard|chipboard]] for the past two centuries.

Food industry mainly include: the production of [[palm oil]], [[bergamot orange|bergamot]] and [[Seville oranges]]. In the west, rubber is processed as well as manufacturing beverages from [[pineapples]], oranges&lt;ref&gt;En Afrique de l'Ouest, les oranges ont la peau verte&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mango]]es, producing robusta [[coffee]]: Côte d'Ivoire is the third largest producer, behind [[Colombia]] and [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tkwa.free.fr/lespaysproducteurs.php |title=Carte des pays producteurs de café |publisher=Tkwa.free.fr |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720231035/http://tkwa.free.fr/lespaysproducteurs.php |archive-date=20 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and processing [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], it is the largest producer in the world ahead of [[Ghana]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/francais/cacao/marche.htm |title=Le marché du cacao |publisher=Unctad.org |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403105821/http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/francais/cacao/marche.htm |archive-date=3 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (37% of cocoa and 10% of coffee products undergo at least one first local processing). Abidjan is also the first African [[tuna]] port for the European market. This generated 3,000 salaried jobs and is an important source of foreign exchange. As in all countries of the Third World developing countries, much of the city's economy lies in what economists describe as informal economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN02103lcononajdib0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195014/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN02103lcononajdib0 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=L'économie parallèle, béquille d'Abidjan. |language=French |date=2001-10-02 |first=Paul |last=Loubière}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its many &quot;odd jobs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Abdou Touré, La civilisation quotidienne en Côte d'Ivoire: Les petits métiers à Abidjan, Éditions Karthala, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tertiary sector ===
The development of tertiary industry, with the establishment of international commercial banks and the increasing number of service companies of all types, appears to be the trend of recent years. Abidjan is the main financial center of [[French West Africa]]. The seat of the common stock exchange of West Africa (BRVM) is located in Abidjan. BRVM is mainly dominated by Ivorian firms.

=== Electricity ===
The thermal power plant Azito, built in 1997 in partnership with [[Électricité de France|EDF]], located on the Yopougon on the edge of the lagoon and facing Ébrié Island Boulay, alone provides 300 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azitoenergie.com/index2.htm |title=La centrale thermique d'Azito |publisher=Azitoenergie.com |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310120018/http://www.azitoenergie.com/index2.htm |archive-date=10 March 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other power plants, built in 1984 and 1985, are installed in [[Vridi]].

Sotra has announced the start of work for the use of light rail to Abidjan. The project has three phases at a cost of 125&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs for a long loop of 32&amp;nbsp;km.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Taxis ====
There are two kinds: the taxi-meter (Red), which can travel throughout the city, and woro-woro (yellow and green, blue or orange depending on the commune), which are limited to a neighborhood.

==== Airport ====
[[Port Bouet Airport]] has a large capacity that allows it to accommodate all existing large aircraft. Abidjan is located an hour's flight from all the capitals of the sub-region. Abidjan is served by major airlines in the direction of the great capitals of the world. Headquarters of the former multinational African Air company, Abidjan airport had nearly 2,070,000 passengers in 2017.

==== Circulation ====
The District&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abidjan-da.ci/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219065904/http://www.abidjan-da.ci/index.html |archivedate=2007-02-19 |title=BIENVENUE}}&lt;/ref&gt; has several paved streets and boulevards linking the towns between them and the District across the country. Abidjan has a network of urban bypasses.

River transport is already consistent with fishing spots and many &quot;boat-buses&quot; connecting the various neighborhoods of the city thrives plan lagoon.

Abidjan is also the bridgehead of the country's only highway linking the city to the administrative and political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]].

==== Port ====
[[File:2009 Abidjan port 3841939455.jpeg|thumb|right|Port of Abidjan, 2009]]
Abidjan has one of the biggest ports in the sub-region (West Africa). It is a container transshipment port and was opened in 1951 in the presence of the Minister of Overseas and Colonies at the time, [[François Mitterrand]]. The 15m deep [[Vridi Canal]], where boats with large draughts can dock in the deep-water port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winne.com/ssa/ivorycoast/reports/2007/cp/port_autonome/index.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233942/http://www.winne.com/ssa/ivorycoast/reports/2007/cp/port_autonome/index.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2007 |title=Le port d'Abidjan |publisher=Winne.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Côte d'Ivoire is in the Franc Zone (where the currency is CFA francs), as part of the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU). Abidjan is the economic centre of both the Côte d'Ivoire and of the whole region, including [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]]; this is mainly because of its deep-water port. The road network in Abidjan (5,600&amp;nbsp;km asphalted in 1995, compared to 1,000&amp;nbsp;km in 1970), which covers the whole region, effectively increases its port activity as 50% of the business from [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]] and [[Niger]] pass through it.

Abidjan receives the bulk of the country's industrial activity; its port alone receiving 60% of ivory park industry. Abidjan has ambitions of oil-production—off-shore production and especially [[refining]] and distribution. In 1995 the port received 12 million tonnes of traffic, of which 5.5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes were petroleum products.

Exports include coffee, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[timber]], [[bananas]], [[pineapple]]s, and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==== Bridges ====
The two-halves of the city, Northern Abidjan and Southern Abidjan, are joined by the Houphouët-Boigny, the Charles de Gaulle and the [[Henri Konan Bédié Bridge|Henri Konan Bédié]] bridges. The two former bridges, built in the 1950s and 1960s respectively, are located between [[Treichville]] and [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]]. The [[Second Abidjan Bridge|Général-de-Gaulle Bridge]] extends over the immense Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Boulevard which leads to the airport. Both bridges are often congested, especially during rush hour or on the occasion of police and military roadblocks.

A third {{cvt|1.5|km|mi}} toll bridge and expressway, the [[Henri Konan Bédié Bridge]] between [[Cocody]] and [[Marcory]] was completed in December 2014. Project construction began in the second half of 2012 and required the relocation of several homes and businesses opposite the Mille Maquis (the noted restaurant ''la Bâche bleue'' was moved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Cadasse |url=http://www.afrik.com/article5740.html |title=La Bache bleue |publisher=Afrik.com |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092841/http://www.afrik.com/article5740.html |archive-date=7 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data reported by the [[African Development Bank]], 2,499 persons were impacted by the bridge construction and were relocated and compensated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Henri Konan Bédié Bridge, a masterpiece in the heart of Abidjan|url=http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/the-henri-konan-bedie-bridge-a-masterpiece-in-the-heart-of-abidjan-13858/|website=www.afdb.org|publisher=African Development Bank Group|accessdate=28 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111000727/http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/the-henri-konan-bedie-bridge-a-masterpiece-in-the-heart-of-abidjan-13858/|archive-date=11 January 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trains and trams ====
{{Main|Rail transport in Côte d'Ivoire}}
[[File:2014 Abidjan train 14462380563.jpg|thumb|left|Train platform, Abidjan, 2014]]
The city is the foothold for the region's only railway:  the Abidjan-[[Ouagadougou]] line, with stations in [[Treichville]], [[Abobo]] and [[Adjamé]]. This line only has two trains, the ''Gazelle'' and the ''Bélier'', and links the two capitals in about 40 hours.&lt;ref&gt;La construction de cette ligne a commencé en 1902. Elle devait à l'origine relier Abidjan à [[Niamey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent project in Abidjan is the [[Abidjan Metro]] which is promised by the Ivory Society of Railroads (SICF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lematindabidjan.com/visual_article.php?num_actualite=648 |title=Article Le matin d'Abidjan |publisher=Lematindabidjan.com |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713200041/http://www.lematindabidjan.com/visual_article.php?num_actualite=648 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of infrastructural projects has been envisaged, including a suburban train system in Abidjan which is estimated to cost almost 100&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs. This suburban train system would link the North-West to the East and North of the city. The project extends over 25&amp;nbsp;km of railway tracks which {{As of|2011|lc=on}} were used by the operator [[Sitarail]], a subsidiary company of the [[Bolloré]] group. The infrastructural works (tracks, electrification, and civil engineers) have been estimated at 40&amp;nbsp;billion [[CFA francs]], financed by the State of Ivory Coast and backers ([[World Bank]] and the French Development Agency). In addition, a BOT concession contract would be given to a private operator, over 20–30 years, to operate the network. This operator will be in charge of the acquisition of railway materials, workshop renovation and the implementation of an organisational system. The concession contract has been estimated at around 60&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Plagecocody.jpg|right|thumb|A beach in [[Cocody]]]]

Abidjan is a unique city in Africa. Its nicknames, such as &quot;Manhattan of the tropics&quot;, &quot;Small Manhattan&quot; or &quot;Pearl of the lagoons&quot;, explain the city's unpredictable and triumphant image. With its accommodation facilities – such as the Golf Hôtel&amp;nbsp;– and sporting facilities, its lively night life, transport and communication lines as well as its impressiveness, it is the perfect city for business tourism.

Abidjan also has beaches around the lagoon, with palm and coconut trees, in the [[Vridi]] area, which are very popular at weekends with the picturesque sight of the pineapple and coconut sellers. Nevertheless, the rip-tides which affects practically the whole of the Gulf of Guinea's coast, means that in this area swimming is not usually allowed. Generally, in Cote d'Ivoire, tourism has never really been developed as an economic industry; the country is not much of a common holiday destination.

==== Parc du Banco (Banco National Park) ====
[[File:Laundry in the river.jpg|left|thumb|Fanicos, Abidjan's washermen]]

Converted in 1926, this park has 3,000 hectares and ancient &quot;sacred wood&quot; lies at the entrance to the city, in the [[Attécoubé]] community, which has been conserved as a relic of the first forest which surrounded the lagoon in the past. A tarmaced road goes straight to the lake at the heart of the park and trails go throughout it. The park is inhabited and there are coffee and [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] plantations.

At the edge of the park, a small river serves as a wash-house where the ''fanicos'', laundry men, work after collecting the laundry from the whole of the city. It is one of the 'small jobs' which exist in Abidjan.

==== Nightlife ====
Overall, the nightlife in Abidjan is considered to be one of the liveliest in the whole of Africa.

The district has an abundance of night-clubs, maquis, out-door areas, and go-go bars. These entertainment platforms provide a musical 'pipeline' encompassing mainly DJs, [[Coupé Décalé]] and [[Zouglou]], and, in lesser amounts, other local and international varieties.

Formerly containing only local traditional varieties, Congolese music and Western music, Abidjan's night life has experienced a positive cultural disruption in its music since the start of the 2000s, with the arrival of [[Coupé Décalé]].

This musical genre was introduced in 2002 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Douk Saga|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|La Jet Set|fr}}, with the help of Sagacité, created a phenomenon which has not stopped spreading and reaching out to the hot nights in the capitals of the sub-region. It has given a globally identifiable cultural identity to entertainment 'made in Côte d'Ivoire'.

The very popular Zouglou additionally benefits &quot;Wôyô&quot; spaces; furnished and dedicated so that the most famous, the Internat at Fitini's and the Lycee at Vieux Gazeur's, attract 'zouglouphiles' the whole weekend.

[[Treichville]], with its many maquis, discothèques, and jazz clubs, used to be the liveliest area in the city, but since the end of the 1990s [[Youpougon]], [[Marcory]], and [[Cocody]] have taken over this role.

=== Music ===
Abidjan is a turntable for West African music, and a major producer of musical art in Africa. The city attracts the majority of musicians from the Côte d'Ivoire mainly because of its many [[dance clubs]], which allow artists to make their debut and express themselves, record companies and national media. Here are a few examples of the most popular artists to have made their debut in Abidjan: [[Alpha Blondy]], [[Aïcha Koné]], the group [[Magic System]], [[Meiway]], and [[Tiken Jah Fakoly]], as well as [[Gadji Celi]], [[Chantal Taiba]], [[Nayanka Bell]], [[DJ Arafat]]. In the 1980s [[Miriam Makeba]] came to Abidjan when she was not allowed back to her own country, [[South Africa]], as did the Congolese diva [[Tshala Muana]], apostle of the Soukous style of dance.

Since the 1990s, Abidjan has had a significant variety of musical styles being exported throughout Africa and the West. These are [[Zoblazo]], [[Mapouka]], [[Zouglou]] and, since 2002, the [[Coupé-Décalé]]; the popularity and great variety of these dances make the city a kind of African dance and musical trend capital. Congo-Kinshasa formerly held this title, with [[Congolese rumba|rumba]], [[soukous]] and then [[ndombolo]]. Abidjan is also considered the reggae capital of Africa.

Each year, the city organises the following music festivals:

==== Press ====
At the time of the single-party, a political situation which ruled over the country for 30 years like most other [[West African countries]] after independence, only one daily newspaper was distributed throughout the country: [[Fraternité Matin]], from the parliamentary group [[PDCI-RDA]], which was founded by the first president, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]. The advent of multiple parties in Côte d'Ivoiret in 1999 can be seen in the proliferation of newspapers and diverse publications, of which the majority is published in Abidjan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.abidjan.net/titrologie |title=Titrologie de la presse ivoirienne |publisher=News.abidjan.net |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326012133/http://news.abidjan.net/titrologie/ |archive-date=26 March 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finals of the 1966, 1986, 1995, and 1998 [[CAF Champions League]] also took place in Abidjan.

The main football event organised in Abidjan was the 1984 [[African Cup of Nations]] and one of the finals of the 1983 [[African Youth Cup of Nations]].

The complex will have, in addition to areas for all different Olympic disciplines (football, athletics, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], etc.), restaurants, shops, auditoriums, conference rooms, a hotel for the sportspeople, and training areas. Since the sudden increase in Ivorian football, the government believes that the national team deserves a better stadium. Although, there was a problem with the &quot;Félicia&quot;: it is impossible to increase its size due to its location in Le Plateau. The project for the new complex was suspended {{As of|2011|lc=on}} because of a lack of investors and the political situation which the country has been experiencing since December 1999.
