'''Finswimming''' is an [[underwater sports|underwater sport]] consisting of four techniques involving [[Human swimming|swimming]] with the use of [[swimfins|fins]] either on the water's surface using a snorkel with either [[monofins]] or bifins  or [[underwater]] with monofin either by holding one's breath or using [[Scuba set#Types#Open circuit|open circuit]] [[scuba diving]] equipment. Events exist over distances similar to [[Swimming (sport)|swimming competitions]] for both [[swimming pool]] and [[open-water diving|open water]] venues.  Competition at world and continental level is organised by the [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques]] (CMAS).  The sport's first world championship was held in 1976.  It also has been featured at the [[World Games]] as a trend sport since 1981 and was demonstrated at the [[2015 European Games]] in June 2015.

==Rules and description of the sport==

===Competitors===
Competitors are described within the International Rules as 'swimmers' rather than as finswimmers or [[underwater diving|divers]].&lt;ref name=Techniques&gt;{{cite book|title=FINSWIMMING - CMAS RULES VERSION 2012/03 In force as from January 1, 2013 (BoD179 - 22/11/2012)|year=2012|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|location=Rome|pages=2–3|url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2538&amp;language=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classes of competition===
Competition is divided in two classes: swimming pool and long distance (also called open water).&lt;ref name=pool&gt;{{cite book|title=FINSWIMMING - CMAS RULES VERSION 2012/03 In force as from January 1, 2013 (BoD179 - 22/11/2012)|year=2012|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|location=Rome|pages=10–14|url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2538&amp;language=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A swimming pool must be 50 m long by 21 m wide and 1.8 m deep, i.e. an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] (also known as a long course pool) suitable for the holding of swimming races for either the [[Olympic Games]] and a [[FINA]] world championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;pool&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FINA FR 3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Facilities Rules: FR 3 Swimming Pools for Olympic Games and World Championships | url = http://www.fina.org/content/fr-3-swimming-pools-olympic-games-and-world-championships| publisher = [[FINA]] | accessdate = 2018-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Rules do not permit the use of 25m length pools (known as [[short course]]) although these are used in regional and national competition.&lt;ref name=FS2013Rules&gt;{{cite book|title=FINSWIMMING - CMAS RULES VERSION 2012/03 In force as from January 1, 2013 (BoD179 - 22/11/2012)|year=2012|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|location=Rome|pages=21–22|url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2538&amp;language=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long distance sites include both the sea and natural water bodies such as freshwater rivers and lakes.  Site selection criteria include 'low current and tides' and water quality 'appropriate for swimming' as certified by a local authority.  The site, when in use for competition, will be marked by buoys, patrolled by safety [[boat]]s and will have observation points (or additional boats) for judges to oversee any turns present in the course.&lt;ref name=&quot;pool&quot;/&gt;

===Techniques===
[[File:SpecialFins.jpg|right|thumb|Monofin &amp; Bi-fins]]

====Surface finswimming====
Surface finswimming (also known by its acronym, '''SF''') is swimming on the surface of the water using mask, snorkel, and monofins.  SF races are held for distances of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1500, 4 × 100 relays and 4 × 200 relays (meters) in swimming pools and over various long distances in the open water environment.  Swimmers must remain on the surface of the water at all times for the duration of the race except when starting or make a turns at the end of a swimming pool where an immersion over a distance of 15m is permitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Techniques&quot;/&gt;

====Apnoea finswimming====
Apnoea finswimming (also known by its acronym, '''AP''', and as '''apnoea''' or '''apnea''') is underwater swimming in a swimming pool using a mask, monofin and holding one's breath.  AP races are held for the distance of 50m.  A swimmer's face must be immersed for the duration of the race otherwise he/she risks disqualification.  AP races are not conducted in open water for 'safety and security reasons'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Techniques&quot;/&gt;

====Immersion finswimming with breathing apparatus====
Immersion finswimming with breathing apparatus (also known by its acronym, '''IM''', and as '''immersion''') is underwater swimming using mask, monofin and underwater breathing apparatus conducted in a swimming pool.  While there are no requirements on how a breathing apparatus is carried, it cannot be exchanged or abandoned during a race.  IM races are held for distances of 100 and 400 m.  A swimmer's face must be immersed for the duration of the race or risk disqualification.  IM races are not conducted in open water for 'safety and security reasons'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Techniques&quot;/&gt;  Historically, IM swims were conducted in open water up to distances of 1000m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A book about History of UW orienteering|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=260186227361650&amp;set=a.260185977361675.60169.255752577805015&amp;type=3&amp;theater|publisher=CMAS|accessdate=19 January 2014|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bi-fins====
Bi-fins (also known by its acronym, '''BF''' or as ''''stereo-fins'''') is swimming on the surface of the water with mask, snorkel and a pair of fins using a crawl style.  BF races are held for distances of 50, 100 and 200m in swimming pools and over various long distances in the open water environment such as 4km and 6km.  It is reported that BF was introduced in 2006 to provide the opportunity for competition by swimmers who cannot afford to purchase a set of monofins.  Swimmers must remain on the surface of the water at all times for the duration of the race except when starting or make a turns at the end of a swimming pool where an immersion of a distance of 15m is permitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Techniques&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=luigiferraro&gt;{{cite web|title=Finswimming|url=http://www.luigiferraro.it/en/finswimming|publisher=Official site dedicated to Luigi Ferraro|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
[[file:skorjenkoflosse.jpg|thumb|Monofin]]
[[File:Tuba-nap.jpg|right|thumb|Finswimming snorkel]]
Finswimming which is often compared to [[Swimming (sport)|sports swimming]]&lt;ref name=strange&gt;{{cite web|title=Strange Sports: There's something fishy down Tuggeranong way...|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133919981|publisher=The Canberra Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|pages=36|date=15 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  differs from that sport in the use of [[diving mask|masks]], fins, snorkels and underwater breathing apparatus.  This reflects the sport’s origins in the [[underwater diving]] techniques of [[snorkelling]], [[freediving|breath-hold diving]] and [[scuba diving|open circuit scuba diving]].

Apart from requiring the use of a mask for protection of the eyes and for the ability to see underwater, the international rules have no requirements regarding selection.  Centre-mounted snorkels (also known as front snorkels) are the only type approved for use subject to meeting minimum and maximum requirements in tube length and internal diameter.  Fins are also regulated by international rules.  Monofins have a maximum size which can be checked by the use of a template while bi-fins must be one of the brands certified (i.e. [[Homologation|homologated]]) by CMAS.&lt;ref name=Equipment&gt;{{cite book|title=FINSWIMMING - CMAS RULES VERSION 2012/03 In force as from January 1, 2013 (BoD179 - 22/11/2012)|year=2012|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|location=Rome|pages=3–6|url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2538&amp;language=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwater breathing apparatus is restricted to open circuit scuba using compressed atmospheric [[air]] as the breathing gas.  The use of [[Nitrox|oxygen enriched mixtures]] is forbidden. [[Diving cylinder|Cylinders]] are limited by maximum [[Diving cylinder#cylinder pressure rating|cylinder pressure rating]] of 200 bar and a minimum [[Diving cylinder#cylinder capacity|cylinder capacity]] of 0.4 litres.  While there are no requirements for [[diving regulator|regulator]]s, swimmers appear to be free to modify these to remove any unnecessary parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Equipment&quot;/&gt;

Garments such as [[Competitive swimwear|swimsuits]], [[swim cap]]s and [[Diving suit|wetsuits]], and the use of logos printed on these garments and the equipment is also subject to the requirements of the international rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Equipment&quot;/&gt;

=== Age groupings and associated restrictions ===
The following age groupings and associated restrictions for both men and women are mandated by the International Rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FINSWIMMING - CMAS RULES VERSION 2012/03 In force as from January 1, 2013 (BoD179 - 22/11/2012)|year=2012|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|location=Rome|page=2|url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2538&amp;language=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and history==
The sport developed in Europe following the ready availability of the first rubber fins during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Marie de Corlieu|url=http://www.scubahalloffame.com/hallmembers/Early%20Pioneers/Corlieu.html|publisher=International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Luigi Ferraro, Italian diving pioneer, is reported as organising the first fin-swimming competition in the sea during 1951 followed by a  {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} ocean swim in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;luigiferraro&quot;/&gt;  The first competition in the [[Soviet Union]] was held during 1958.&lt;ref name=CMAShistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Underwater Sports: Finswimming|url=http://history.cmas.org/finswimming|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|accessdate=3 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215163844/http://history.cmas.org/finswimming|archive-date=15 December 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European Championship which was a [[multi sport event]] involving both finswimming and [[underwater orienteering]] was held under the title of the First European Championship of Subaquatics Technical at [[Angera]], [[Italy]] in August 1967.  The specific finswimming events were races over the distances of 40m and 1000m which are reported as using either surface swimming techniques or respectively apnoea and immersion techniques.  In 1969, the first European Finswimming Championship to be separate of underwater orienteering was held in [[Locarno]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CMAShistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st European Championship|url=http://www.cmas.org/finswimming/114-28099.php|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first World Championships were held in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]] during 1976 followed by the inclusion of the sport in the inaugural [[World Games]] in [[Santa Clara, California]], USA during 1981. In 1988, the first World Long Distance Championship was held in [[Paris]], [[France]] followed in 1989 by the first World Junior Championship in [[Dunaújváros]], [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CMAShistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st World Championship|url=http://www.cmas.org/finswimming/114-28113.php|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underwater Sports: Fin Swimming|url=http://www.theworldgames.org/the-sports/sports/trend-sports/underwater-sports-fin-swimming|publisher=the International World Games Association|accessdate=18 August 2013|pages=|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the monofin in the early 1970s lead to the breaking of all world records by the end of the decade due to the improved performance possible when used in lieu of bi-fins.&lt;ref name=&quot;luigiferraro&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, the first Bi Fin races using CMAS homologated fins were held.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMAShistory&quot;/&gt;

==Sporting appeal and training==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{ original research |section |date=January 2014}}
{{refimprove section| date=January 2014}}
}}

===Appeal===
The main appeal of finswimming is reported by some as being the speed that a swimmer can reach.&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;   The world record for the men's 50 m freestyle (long course) in sports swimming (see [[List of world records in swimming|World records in swimming]]), is 20.91 seconds (by [[César Cielo]] of [[Brazil]]). In finswimming it is 13.85 seconds (for 50 m apnoea by Pavel Kabanov of [[Russia]]) (see [[List of world records in finswimming|World records in finswimming]]). This is a 50% increase in speed over sports swimming.

One of the great appeals of finswimming is that finswimmers do not need to be good sports swimmers.{{citation needed|date= January 2014}}   Indeed, there is some evidence that top flight sports swimmers may make poorer finswimmers than well-trained finswimmers (see below).{{citation needed|date= January 2014}}

===Training===
Unlike most sports swimming training programmes, finswimming training tends to be far more specific and more like systems used for track running in [[sport of athletics|athletics]].{{citation needed|date= January 2014}}   In addition, finswimming training tends to have more dry-side work, including a huge amount of [[core stability]] (as core strength), [[plyometrics]] and [[weight training]].{{citation needed|date= August 2014}}

It has been recorded that sports swimmers tend to approach finswimming with preconceptions on technique, which can limit their success.&lt;ref&gt;Koulianou, M. &amp; S. Vosniadou (2002). Differences between experts and novices in finswimming: A cognitive system analysis. Res-Systemica, 2, Special Issue: Proceedings of the fifth European Systems Science Congress, October 2002, Crete.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koulianou, M. &amp; S. Vosniadou (2003). Differences between experts and novices in finswimming: A cognitive analysis of sports behavior. 2003 Cognitive Science Society European Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koulianou, M. &amp; S. Vosniadou (2006). Effects of Incompatible Prior Knowledge in Butterfly Style on Understanding Finswimming Style. Cognitive Science Journal, 30: 2539.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing body==
The governing body is the CMAS Finswimming Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About finswimming|url=http://www.cmas.org/finswimming/about-2012032622|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its role includes the upgrading of the rules of competition when required, keeping of records for CMAS championships, the World Games and these of national federations where these match or exceed records achieved at international level, and the maintenance of the CMAS World Ranking which is a listing of the best performing senior and junior men and women from both the most recent [[Finswimming World Championships]] and the rounds of the World Cup.  It also assists the CMAS Board of Directors and others organising competitions organised under the auspices of CMAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FINSWIMMING - CMAS RULES VERSION 2012/03 In force as from January 1st 2013 (BoD179 - 22/11/2012)|year=2012|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|location=Rome|page=10 &amp; 21–22|url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2538&amp;language=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2015, national federations in the following countries and territories have affiliated with the Commission: [[Algeria]], [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Austria]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Belarus]], [[Canada]], [[Cameroon]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[China]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kenya]], [[Korea]], [[Kuwait]], [[Kyrgyz Republic]], [[Lebanon]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Libya]], [[Mexico]], [[Marianas]], [[Montenegro]], [[Netherlands]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[San Marino]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Serbia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Syria]], [[Russia]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[United States of America]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federations (finswimming)|url= http://www.cmas.org/cmas/federations?continent=&amp;comme=0&amp;commi=4 |publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition at international level ==

===CMAS competitions===
As of 2007, CMAS directly oversees the following four competitions at international level: the World Championship, Continental Championships, the World Cup and the CMAS Junior Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FINSWIMMING - CMAS RULES VERSION 2012/03 In force as from January 1, 2013 (BoD179 - 22/11/2012)|year=2012|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|location=Rome|page=8|url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2538&amp;language=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
