'''Cahuita''' is a small city located on the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Costa Rica]],  in the [[Talamanca (canton)|Talamanca Canton]] of [[Limón Province]]. Cahuita is the capital of the Cahuita District.

==Culture and nearby attractions==
Due to its proximity to the Caribbean shoreline, Cahuita is renowned for Afro-Caribbean influence on dining and local culture. The city is specifically known for its beaches, dessert [[crepe]]s (often including local bananas, strawberries, and chocolate), and variations of grilled chicken. The Playa Negra (Black Beach) and [[Cahuita National Park]] are close to town. [[Limón]] is north of Cahuita. [[Puerto Viejo de Talamanca|Puerto Viejo]] is the next town south.
The town is also home to Walter Gavitt Ferguson Byfield or [[Walter Ferguson (singer-songwriter)]], the &quot;King of Calypso,&quot; born in 1919 and still active. His 100th birthday in 2019 was declared National Calypso Day by Costa Rica's Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07y8pgj&lt;/ref&gt;

==Road conditions==

Cahuita is served by National Route 36, which connects Puerto Limón to Sixaola.  Many roads in Cahuita are composed of dirt, gravel, and stone, often making it necessary for foreign visitors to rent a [[4WD]] vehicle to reach local beaches and hotels on the northern fringes of town.

==Climate==
Cahuita has a tropical climate. Temperatures remain consistent during the year. Sunrise and sunset change very little during the year (about 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM, respectively). Limón International Airport is nearby and has similar average temperatures and precipitation.
