{{Nihongo|'''Inuoumono'''|犬追物}} was a Japanese sport that involved mounted archers shooting at dogs. The dogs were released into a circular enclosure approximately 15m across, and mounted archers would fire upon them whilst riding around the perimeter.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrédéricRoth2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis Frédéric|author2=Käthe Roth|title=Japan Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA392|accessdate=22 February 2013|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01753-5|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inuoumono waned in popularity during the sixteenth century and has been largely extinct as a practice since then. It was eventually banned outright during the reign of [[Tokugawa Iemochi]]. Occasional revivals have taken place: there is a record of the shōgun [[Tokugawa Ieyoshi]] viewing dog-shooting in 1842, and the sport was performed for [[Ulysses S. Grant]] during an official visit to Japan in 1879 (Grant reportedly expressed distaste for the practice).&lt;ref name=&quot;GuttmannThompson2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allen Guttmann|author2=Lee Austin Thompson|title=Japanese Sports: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbOau1trIMMC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=22 May 2012|year=2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2464-8|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last recorded instance of dog-shooting took place before the [[Meiji Emperor]] in 1881.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bargen2006&quot;/&gt;
