'''Vigoro''' is a team sport, played mainly by women in [[Sport in Australia|Australia]], that originally combined elements of [[cricket]] and [[tennis]], although in its current form it may be more similar to cricket and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name = BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28237387|title=Vigoro: The Edwardian attempt to merge tennis and cricket|date=22 July 2014|accessdate=22 July 2014|author=Justin Parkinson|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The game was invented in 1901 by Englishman John George Grant.{{efn|name=grosvenor|In early publications on the game the Hon. Algernon Grosvenor is also mentioned as inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing at Vigoro|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WC19010816.2.4|work=Wanganui Chronicle|date=16 August 1901|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name = BBC /&gt; In the original version tennis rackets were used and the [[wicket]] consisted of six stumps. On 17 October 1902, a match was played before the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC committee]] at [[Lord's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pars from London|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000412/19020930/048/0003|work=Northants Evening Telegraph|publisher=British Newspaper Archive|date=30 September 1902|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; An eleven led by [[real tennis]] and rackets player [[Eustace Miles]], and including Wimbledon champions [[Laurence Doherty|Laurence]] and [[Reginald Doherty]], defeated the opposition, led by [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] batsman [[Bobby Abel]]. Miles' team led after the first innings by 73 to 18 runs and won by an innings after Abel's team made only 39 runs in the second innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Strange Game of &quot;Vigoro&quot;|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000273/19021018/020/0006|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|date=18 October 1902|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month the game was also played at [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rival to cricket|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000582/19021011/098/0005|work=Dundee Evening Post|publisher=British Newspaper Archive|date=11 October 1902|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games were also played that year, and in 1903, at London's [[Queen's Club]].&lt;ref name = BBC /&gt; In England interest in the game  died down after a few years but it managed to gain a foothold in Australia where it was introduced during [[World War]] I. A key figure in the promotion of the game in Australia was Ettie Dodge, who was President (1919–66) of the New South Wales Women's Vigoro Association and foundation president (1932–66) of the All Australian [Vigoro] Association. Ettie's husband had met John George Grant in [[England]]. When the game was introduced to [[New South Wales]] schools in the 1920s, Dodge &amp; Co. began selling vigoro equipment. Grant died in 1927 and bequeathed the trademark and copyright of the game to Ettie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140016b.htm &quot;Ettie Dodge (1885 - 1973)&quot;] by Anne-Marie Gaudry, ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 14, 1996, retrieved (from online edition) 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Vigoro is played on a pitch which shall be no shorter than 17.68 m [58'],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qldvigoro.com.au/sites/default/files/files/uploads/All%20Australian%20Vigoro%20Rules%20October%202006.pdf]'', All Australian Vigoro Rules October 2006.pdf, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; which is slightly shorter in length than a cricket pitch. The balls are much lighter than those for cricket, and the bat has a different shape with a long handle resembling the shape of a paddle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigoro.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=28 NSW Vigoro Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821021038/http://www.vigoro.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=28 |date=21 August 2006 }} &quot;About us&quot; section, retrieved 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lucy|title=Vigoro is a strategic sport|url=https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/vigoro-is-a-strategic-sport/2798549/|accessdate=7 April 2018|publisher=Daily Mercury|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two teams of 12 players which will bat and field two innings each (except in the event that a team wins with an innings in hand). The aim of the game is for a team to score more runs than the opposition team.

There are no overs and the batsmen bat from one end only. Two bowlers bowl alternately and can incorporate any type of &quot;throwing&quot; action as long as the ball is released above the shoulder (i.e. not underarm).

If the ball is hit forward of the crease, the batter must run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2013/03/22/3721875.htm ABC Northern Tasmania] &quot;All Australian Vigoro Titles&quot;, retrieved 9 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A run is completed each time both batters safely make it to the crease at the opposite end of the pitch. Fours and sixes also apply where the batter hits the ball past the boundary markers. In addition to shots made off the bat, byes and leg-byes add to the team's score.

Players may be dismissed by the same methods as in [[Laws of cricket#Ways to get out|cricket]] – [[bowled]], [[caught (cricket)|caught]], [[run out]], [[stumped]], [[leg before wicket]], [[hit wicket]], [[Handled the ball|handled ball]] and [[hit the ball twice]].
