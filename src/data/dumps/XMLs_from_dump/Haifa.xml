Built on the slopes of [[Mount Carmel]], the settlement has a history spanning more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was [[Tell Abu Hawam]], a small port city established in the Late [[Bronze Age]] (14th century BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[[Encyclopaedia Judaica|Encyclopedia Judaica]], ''Haifa,'' Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1972, vol. 7, pp. 1134–1139&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a dye-making center. Over the millennia, the Haifa area has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the [[Canaanites]], [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israelites]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Hasmoneans]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Arab]]s, [[Crusades|Crusaders]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], and the [[Mandatory Palestine|British]]. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Haifa Municipality has governed the city.

{{As of | 2016}}, the city is a major [[Port of Haifa|seaport]] located on Israel's [[Israeli coastal plain|Mediterranean]] coastline in the [[Haifa Bay|Bay of Haifa]] covering {{convert|63.7|km2|sqmi}}. It lies about {{convert|90|km|mi|0}} north of Tel Aviv and is the major regional center of northern Israel. According to researcher [[Jonathan Kis-Lev]], Haifa is considered a relative haven for coexistence between Jews and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kis-Lev |first=Jonathan |date=2015 |title=My Quest For Peace: One Israeli's Journey From Hatred To Peacemaking |url=|location=|publisher=Goldsmith Press |page=|isbn=978-1537163536 |author-link=Jonathan Kis-Lev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two respected academic institutions, the [[University of Haifa]] and the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]], are located in Haifa, in addition to the largest [[K–12]] school in Israel, the [[Hebrew Reali School]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Western Haifa from the air.jpg|thumb|Western Haifa from the air]]

The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from the name of the high priest Caiaphas. Some [[Christians]] believe it was named for [[Saint Peter]], whose [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] name was Keiphah.&lt;ref name=&quot;pardes&quot;/&gt; Another theory holds it could be derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verb root חפה (''hafa''), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa;&lt;ref name=&quot;pardes&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Alex |last=Carmel |year=2002 |title=The History of Haifa Under Turkish Rule |edition=4th |publisher=Pardes |location=Haifa |isbn=965-7171-05-9 |language=Hebrew |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (''hof''), meaning &quot;shore&quot;, or חוֹף יָפֶה (''hof yafe''), meaning &quot;beautiful shore&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pardes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Amit-Kokhavi |first=Hanah |title=Haifa—sea and mountain, Arab past and Jewish present, as reflected by four writers |journal=Israel Studies |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=2006 |pages=142–167 |doi=10.1353/is.2006.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other spellings in English included ''Caipha'', ''Kaipha'', ''Caiffa'', ''Kaiffa'' and ''Khaifa''.&lt;ref name=MacMillan&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_hxHAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=khaifa+caiffa&amp;dq=khaifa+caiffa |title=Guide to Palestine and Syria: Macmillan's guides |edition=5th |publisher=Macmillan and Company |year=1910 |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations and names==
===Sycaminum and Efa===
The earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was a city known as '''[[Tel Shikmona|Sycaminum]]'''.&lt;ref name=Dumperp159 /&gt; The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]], or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as '''[[Tel Shikmona]]''',&lt;ref name=Sharon /&gt; meaning &quot;mound of the [[Ficus sycomorus]]&quot;, and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as Tell el-Semak or Tell es-Samak, meaning &quot;mound of the [[sumak]] trees&quot;, names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the [[Mishnah]] (composed c. 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it.&lt;ref name=Sharon&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharon |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Sharon |author2=Fondation Max van Berchem |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1d8xHcor0psC&amp;pg=PA99 |title=Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae addendum: squeezes in the Max van Berchem collection (Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Northern Syria) |edition=Illustrated |publisher=BRILL |year=2007 |isbn=9789004157804 |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEF1875 /&gt;

The name '''Efa''' first appears during [[Palestine (region)#Roman rule (63 BC)|Roman rule]], some time after the end of the 1st century, when a Roman fortress and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona.&lt;ref name=Dumperp159&gt;{{Cite book |last= Dumper |first= Michael |last2= Stanley |first2= Bruce E. |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;pg=PA159 |title= Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: a historical encyclopedia |edition= Illustrated |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2007 |isbn= 9781576079195 |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharon/&gt; Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the [[Talmud]], a work central to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name=Sharon /&gt;

'''Hefa''' or '''Hepha''' in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s 4th-century work, ''Onomasticon'' (''Onom.'' 108, 31), is said to be another name for Sycaminus.&lt;ref name=Negev&gt;{{cite book |pages=213–214 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA213 |title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land |first1=Avraham |last1=Negev |first2=Shimon |last2=Gibson |edition=4th, revised, illustrated |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005 |isbn=9780826485717}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synonymizing of the names is explained by [[Moshe Sharon]], who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis.&lt;ref name=Sharon /&gt; References to this city end with the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

===Porphyreon===
Around the 6th century, '''Porphyreon''' or '''Porphyrea''' is mentioned in the writings of [[William of Tyre]],{{dubious|WRONG! W.o.T. lived 600 years later|date=October 2019}} and while it lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharon /&gt;

===Early Muslim Haifa===
Following the Arab conquest in the 7th century, '''Haifa''' was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona).&lt;ref name=Sharon /&gt; Haifa (or Haifah) is mentioned by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler [[Nasir Khusraw]], and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].&lt;ref name=Strange /&gt;

===Crusader Caiphas===
The [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, call it '''Caiphas''',&lt;ref name=Dumperp159/&gt; and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of [[Simon Peter]].&lt;ref name=PEF1875&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme07pale/quarterlystateme07pale_djvu.txt |title= Quarterly Statement - Palestine Exploration Fund |publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |year= 1876 |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as Caiaphas civitas,&lt;ref name=Rodgersp194&gt;{{cite book |last1= Freyne |first1= Seán |last2= Rodgers |first2= Zuleika |last3= Daly-Denton |first3= Margaret |last4= Fitzpatrick-McKinley |first4= Anne |url= https://books.google.com/?id=5I8zfmwEjjUC&amp;pg=PA194 |title= A wandering Galilean: essays in honour of Seán Freyne |publisher= BRILL |year= 2009 |isbn= 9789004173552 |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city's founding to [[Caiaphas]], the Jewish high priest at the time of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=PEF1875 /&gt;

===Late Ottoman &quot;Old Haifa&quot;===
'''Haifa al-'Atiqa''' (Arabic: &quot;Ancient Haifa&quot;) is another name used by some locals to refer to Tell es-Samak, when it was the site of Haifa while a hamlet of 250 residents, before it was moved in 1764-5 to the site from which the modern city emerged.&lt;ref name=Seikalyp15 /&gt;

===Haifa al-Jadida (New Haifa) and modern Haifa===
In 1764-5 [[Zahir al-Umar]] moved the village to a new site  {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=off}} to the east, which he also fortified.&lt;ref name=Seikalyp15&gt;{{cite book |page=15 |title=Haifa: Transformation of an Arab Society 1918–1939 |first=May |last=Seikaly |edition=Illustrated, reprint |publisher=I.B.

In the early 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was repopulated with many [[Arab Christian]]s in an overall neighborhood in which many [[Mizrahi Jews|Middle Eastern Jews]] were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location.&lt;ref name=Seikalyp65&gt;Seikaly, 2002, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Haifa|Timeline of Haifa}}
[[File:Tell Abu Hawam 006.jpg|thumb|Jars excavated at [[Tell Abu Hawam]]]]

===Bronze Age: Tell Abu Hawam===
A town known today as [[Tell Abu Hawam]] was established during the Late [[Bronze Age]] (14th century BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt; It was a port and fishing village.

===In the Hebrew Bible===
Mount Carmel and the [[Kishon River]] are mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kings&quot;&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Kishon.html |title=Kishon |publisher=HighBeam Encyclopedia (Colombia Encyclopedia) |accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A grotto on the top of Mount Carmel is known as the &quot;Cave of Elijah&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triptern.com/guide/haifa-Cave-of-Elijah |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130615220103/http://www.triptern.com/guide/haifa-Cave-of-Elijah |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally linked to the Prophet [[Elijah]] and his apprentice, Elisha.&lt;ref name=&quot;kings&quot; /&gt; In Arabic, the highest peak of the Carmel range is called the ''Muhraka'', or &quot;place of burning,&quot; harking back to the burnt offerings and sacrifices there in Canaanite and early Israelite times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bahai-library.com/ullian_israel_haifa |title=Book Excerpt: Frommer's Guide to Israel, &quot;Haifa&quot; |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date=21 April 1948 |access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian and Hellenistic period: near Shikmona===
In the 6th century BCE, during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period, Greek geographer [[Scylax of Caryanda|Scylax]] wrote of a city &quot;between the bay and the Promontory of Zeus&quot; (i.e., the Carmel), which may be a reference to [[Shikmona]], a locality in the Haifa area.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

By [[Hellenistic]] times, the city had moved to a new site south of what is now [[Bat Galim]] because the old port's harbour had become blocked with sand.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; A [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking population living along the coast at this time was engaged in commerce.&lt;ref&gt;''Haifa'', The Guide to Israel, Zev Vilnay, Jerusalem, 1970, p.382&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shikmona====
Haifa was located near the town of [[Shikmona]], a center for making the traditional [[Tzitzit#Tekhelet|Tekhelet]] dye used in the garments of the high priests in the Temple. The [[archaeological site]] of Shikmona is southwest of Bat Galim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/hecht/abstract/15e/Abstracts.pdf |format=PDF |title=Two Tombstones from Zoar in the Hecht Museum Collection |publisher=[[University of Haifa|Haifa University]] |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226230016/http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/hecht/abstract/15e/Abstracts.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Haifa is believed to have occupied the area which extends from the present-day Rambam Hospital to the Jewish Cemetery on Yafo Street. The inhabitants engaged in fishing and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.haifa.muni.il/aliya/pagesForPrint.aspx?pageName=History&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
About the 3rd century CE, the city was first mentioned in [[Talmud]]ic literature, as a Jewish fishing village and the home of Rabbi [[Avdimi of Haifa|Avdimi]] and other Jewish scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JVL&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/viehaifa.html |title=Haifa |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine period===
Under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=213 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA213 |title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land |first1=Avraham |last1=Negev |first2=Shimon |last2=Gibson |edition=4th, revised, illustrated |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=1 July 2005 |isbn=9780826485717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Muslim period===
Following the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s-40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of [[Acre, Israel|'Akka]].&lt;ref name=Bosworth/&gt; Under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], Haifa began to develop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabois&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grabois |first=Aryeh |title= Haifa and Its Settlement in the Middle Ages |journal=Ariel: Haifa and Its Sites |date=March 1985 |issue=37–39 |pages=48–49 |editor1-first=Eli |editor1-last=Shiller |editor2-first=Yossi |editor2-last=Ben-Artzi |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]]s, Haifa established trading relations with [[Egypt]]ian ports and the city featured several shipyards. The inhabitants, [[Arab]]s and [[Jew]]s, engaged in trade and maritime commerce. Glass production and dye-making from marine snails were the city's most lucrative industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabois&quot; /&gt;

===Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===
[[File:Haifa and Mount Carmel (before 1899).jpg|thumb|Mount Carmel before 1899]]
Prosperity ended in 1100 or 1101, when Haifa was besieged and blockaded by European Christians shortly after the end of the [[First Crusade]], and then conquered after a fierce battle with its Jewish inhabitants and Fatimid garrison.&lt;ref name=AlCarmel&gt;{{Cite book |first=Alex |last=Carmel |year=2002 |title=The History of Haifa Under Turkish Rule |edition=4th |publisher=Pardes |location=Haifa |isbn=965-7171-05-9 |language=Hebrew |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=634to1099&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Palestine, 634-1099 |first=Moshe |last=Gil |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=829 |isbn=9780521404372 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tSM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA829 |quote=Haifa was taken [...] in August 1100 or June 1101, according to Muslim sources which contradict one another. Albert of Aachen does not mention the date in a clear manner either. From what he says, it appears that it was mainly the Jewish inhabitants of the city who defended the fortress of Haifa. In his rather strange Latin style, he mentions that there was a Jewish population in Haifa, and that they fought bravely on the walls of the city. He explains that the Jews there were protected people of the Muslims (the Fatimids). They fought side by side with units of the Fatimid army, striking back at Tancred's army from above the walls of the citadel (... ''Judaei civis comixtis Sarracenorum turmis'') until the Crusaders overcame them and they were forced to abandon the walls. The Muslims and the Jews then managed to escape from the fortress with their lives, while the rest of the population fled the city ''en masse''. Whoever remained was slaughtered, and huge quantities of spoils were taken. [...] [Note #3: Albert of Aachen (Albericus, Albertus Aquensis), ''Historia Hierosolymitanae Expeditionis'', in: [[Recueil des historiens des croisades|''RHC'']] (Occ.), IV. p. 523; etc.] |access-date=17 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Crusaders, Haifa was reduced to a small fortified coastal stronghold.&lt;ref name=AlCarmel /&gt; It was a part of the [[Principality of Galilee]] within the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Following their victory at the [[Battle of Hattin]], [[Saladin]]'s [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] army captured Haifa in mid-July 1187 and the city's Crusader fortress was destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane-Poole, 1906, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second Crusade|The Crusaders]] under [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] retook Haifa in 1191.&lt;ref&gt;Lane-Poole, 1906, p.309.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1596, Haifa appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of Sahil Atlit of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of Lajjun. It had a population of 32 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hütteroth |first=Wolf-Dieter |last2=Abdulfattah |first2=Kamal |title=Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century |year=1977 |publisher=Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5.

Haifa was a hamlet of 250 inhabitants in 1764-5.

In 1765 [[Zahir al-Umar]], the [[Arab]] ruler of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and the [[Galilee]], moved the population to a new fortified site {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=off}} to the east and laid waste to the old site.&lt;ref name=Seikalyp15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haifa in the Late Ottoman Period, 1864–1914: A Muslim Town in Transition By Mahmud Yazbak BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11051-8}} p 14&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Moshe Sharon]], the new Haifa was established by Zahir in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae: H-I |volume=5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X1uNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263 |first=Moshe |last=Sharon|authorlink=Moshe Sharon |year=2013 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004254817 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event marked the beginning of the town's life at its modern location.&lt;ref name=Seikalyp15 /&gt;

After al-Umar's death in 1775, the town remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule until 1918, with the exception of two brief periods.

In 1799, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] conquered Haifa during his unsuccessful campaign to conquer Palestine and [[Syria]], but he soon had to withdraw; in the campaign's [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria#Acre|final proclamation]], Napoleon took credit for having razed the fortifications of &quot;Kaïffa&quot; (as the name was spelled at the time) along with those of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Jaffa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].

Between 1831 and 1840, the [[Egypt]]ian viceroy [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] governed Haifa, after his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] had wrested control over it from the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/37/c2 |title=Haifa during the British Mandate Period |publisher=Tour-Haifa.co.il |access-date=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;modern&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/38/c2 |title=Modern Haifa |access-date=15 February 2008 |publisher=Tour-Haifa.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Egyptian occupation ended and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] declined, the importance of Haifa rose.

The arrival of German messianics, many of whom were [[Templers (religious believers)|Templers]], in 1868, who settled in what is now known as the [[German Colony, Haifa|German Colony of Haifa]], was a turning point in Haifa's development.&lt;ref name=&quot;modern&quot;/&gt; The Templers built and operated a steam-based [[power station]], opened factories and inaugurated carriage services to Acre, [[Nazareth]] and [[Tiberias]], playing a key role in modernizing the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schumacher.haifa.ac.il/templers.htm |title=Templers |access-date=27 January 2008 |publisher=[[University of Haifa]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701120321/http://schumacher.haifa.ac.il/templers.htm |archivedate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haifa 1975.jpg|thumb|Palestine Exploration Fund map of Haifa, 1875]]

The first major wave of Jewish immigration to Haifa took place in the mid-19th century from [[Morocco]], with a smaller wave of immigration from [[Turkey]] a few years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Gaon |first=Moshe David |url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/36725 |title=The History of the Sephardi Jews in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s, large numbers of Jewish and Arab migrants came to Haifa due to the town's growing prosperity. Jews constituted one-eighth of Haifa's population, almost all of whom were recent immigrants from Morocco and Turkey who lived in the Jewish Quarter, which was located in the eastern part of the town. Continued Jewish immigration gradually raised the Jewish population of Haifa, and included a small number of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] families, most of whom opened hotels for Jewish migrants coming into the city. A wave of European Jews arrived at the end of the 19th century from [[Romania]]. The Central Jewish Colonisation Society in Romania purchased over {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} near Haifa. As the Jewish settlers had been city dwellers, they hired the former fellahin tenants to instruct them in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, Laurence. (1886) ''Haifa, or Life in Modern Palestine''. Adamant Media Corporation, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Aliyah]] of the late 19th century and the [[Second Aliyah]] of the early 20th century saw Jewish immigrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, arrive in Haifa in significant numbers. The Jewish population rose from 1,500 in 1900 to 3,000 on the eve of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmel, Alex: ''Ottoman Haifa: A History of Four Centuries under Turkish Rule''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haifa 6801-11.jpg|thumb|[[Shrine of the Báb]] and the [[Baháʼí gardens]] on [[Mount Carmel]]]]
In 1909, Haifa became important to the [[Baháʼí Faith]] when the remains of the [[Báb]], founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of [[Baháʼu'lláh]] in the Baháʼí Faith, were moved from [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] to Haifa and [[Shrine of the Báb|interred in the shrine]] built on [[Mount Carmel]]. Baháʼís consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the [[Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh]] in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Baháʼu'lláh himself to his eldest son, [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]], in 1891. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]]. In a separate room, the [[Shrine of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|remains of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] were buried in November 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Golden anniversary of the Queen of Carmel |url=http://news.bahai.org/story/252 |publisher=Baháʼí World News Service |date=12 October 2003 |access-date=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Haifa began to emerge as an industrial port city and growing population center. A branch of the [[Hejaz Railway|Hejaz railway]], known as the [[Jezreel Valley railway]], was built between 1903 and 1905. The railway increased the city's volume of trade, and attracted workers and foreign merchants. In 1912, construction began on the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion Institute of Technology]], a Jewish technical school that was to later become one of Israel's top universities, although studies did not begin until 1924. The Jews of Haifa also founded numerous factories and cultural institutions.

The British made preparations to enter the city and came under fire in the [[Balad al-Sheikh]] district (today [[Nesher]]). After the British regrouped, an elite unit of Indian horsemen were sent to attack the Turkish positions on the flanks and overrun their artillery guns on Mount Carmel.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz.com&quot;/&gt;

The port was a major source of income, and the nearby towns of the [[Krayot]] were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as Syrian [[Hauran]].&lt;ref name=Schulze98&gt;Reinhard Schulze. ''A modern history of the Islamic world''. p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop.&lt;ref name=Schulze98 /&gt; The [[1922 census of Palestine]], conducted by the British authorities, recorded Haifa as having a population of 9,377 Muslims, 8,863 Christians, 6,230 Jews, and 164 others.

Haifa's development owed much to British plans to make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Ronen (2013) ''Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine''. Stanford: Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The State-run [[Palestine Railways]] also built its main workshops in Haifa.

By 1945 the population had shifted to 33% Muslim, 20% Christian and 47% Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Supplement to a Survey of Palestine (p. 12–13) which was prepared by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] for [[United Nations|the United Nations]] in 1946–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.haifa.muni.il/aliya/pages.aspx?pageName=History |title=Haifa Municipality – Aliya Web Site |publisher=.haifa.muni.il |accessdate=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012143611/http://www1.haifa.muni.il/aliya/pages.aspx?pageName=History |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, about 70,910 Arabs (41,000 Muslims and 29,910 Christians) and 74,230 Jews were living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Maps/Story574.html |title=Supplement to a Survey of Palestine |accessdate=11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian community were mostly [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Melkite Catholics]].

The [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 UN Partition Plan]] in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed [[Jewish state]]. Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December.&lt;ref&gt;Palestine Post, many issues December 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab city was in a state of chaos. The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight. In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: &quot;Keep away the cowards who wish to flee. Expell them from your lines. Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy&quot;. Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Independence Versus Nakba''; Kinneret–Zmora-Bitan–Dvir Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|965-517-190-6}}, pp.136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 1947, members of the [[Irgun]], a Jewish underground militia, threw bombs into a crowd of [[Arabs]] outside the gates of the Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in what became known as the [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Israel/Palestine Question |authorlink=Ilan Pappé |first=Ilan |last=Pappé |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-415-16947-9 |id={{ISBN|0-415-16947-X}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[Haganah]] militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of [[Balad al-Shaykh]], where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the [[Balad al-Shaykh massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', p101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Armed Forces|British forces]] in Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. Two days later the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by [[Yishuv|Jewish]] forces in [[Battle of Haifa (1948)|Operation Bi'ur Hametz]], by the [[Barak Armored Brigade|Carmeli Brigade]] of the [[Haganah]], commanded by [[Moshe Carmel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The operation led to a massive [[1948 Palestinian exodus|displacement]] of Haifa's Arab population. According to ''The Economist'' at the time, only 5,000–6,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/refugees1.htm |title=The Palestine Refugee Problem |publisher=Mideastweb.org |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneous sources emphasized the Jewish leadership's attempt to stop the Arab exodus from the city and the Arab leadership as a motivating factor in the refugees' flight. According to the British district superintendent of police, &quot;Every effort is being made by the Jews to persuade the Arab populace to stay and carry on with their normal lives, to get their shops and business open and to be assured that their lives and interests will be safe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Karsh, Efraim. ''Palestine Betrayed''. New Haven: Yale UP, 2010. 124.

By withdrawing Arab workers their leaders hoped to paralyze Haifa.&quot;

[[Benny Morris]] said Haifa's Arabs left due to a combination of Zionist threats and encouragement to do so by Arab leaders. [[Ilan Pappé]] writes that the shelling culminated in an attack on a Palestinian crowd in the old marketplace using three-inch (76&amp;nbsp;mm) mortars on 22 April 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, Ilan (1992).

Morris quotes British sources as stating that during the battles between 22 and 23 April 100 Arabs were killed and 100 wounded, but he adds that the total may have been higher.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benny (1987), ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1949''.

After the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them [[Kiryat Haim|Kiryat Hayim]], Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and [[Kiryat Eliezer, Haifa|Kiryat Eliezer]]. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in [[Hadar HaCarmel|Hadar Hacarmel]] date from this period. In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|title=History since Independence |accessdate=9 April 2008 |url=http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/36/c2 |publisher=Haifa Municipality}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, a group of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]], mostly [[Moroccan Jews]], rioted in [[Wadi Salib]], claiming the state was discriminating against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=1099078&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=15&amp;title=%27The%20Makings%20of%20History%20/%20So%20much%20for%20the%20melting%20pot%20%27&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 So much for the melting pot, Tom Segev] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their demand for &quot;bread and work&quot; was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] elite in the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] and the [[Histadrut]].&lt;ref name = Johal/&gt;

[[Tel Aviv]] gained in status, while Haifa suffered a decline in the role as regional capital. The opening of [[Ashdod]] as a port exacerbated this.

Haifa is Israel's third-largest city, consisting of 103,000 households,&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot; /&gt; or a population of {{Israel populations|Haifa}}.

Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-94951-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1994 and 2009, the city had a declining and [[Population ageing|aging population]] compared to [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], as young people moved to the center of the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to [[Bedroom community|bedroom communities]] in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.&lt;ref name=Monocle/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbaneconomics.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-haifa-aging.html |publisher=urbaneconomics.blogspot.com |title=Is Haifa Ageing? |accessdate=10 February 2008 |date=6 December 2006 |work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Statistical Abstract of Israel, no. 56, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A development plan approved in 2016 seeks to raise Haifa's population to 330,000 residents by 2025.&lt;ref name=globes&gt;http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-new-haifa-outline-plan-55000-more-residents-by-2025-1001159957&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious and ethnic communities===
[[File:Hadar and Carmel.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hadar HaCarmel]] neighborhood]]
The population is heterogeneous. [[Israeli Jews]] comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are [[Christians in Israel|Christians]] (the majority of whom are [[Arab Christians]])&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot; /&gt; and, some 4% are [[Islam in Israel|Muslims]] (of which 20% are [[Ahmadiyya in Israel|Ahmadi]]s&lt;ref&gt;There are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir of the 4% (under 11,000) Muslims:

Haifa also includes [[Druze]] and [[Baháʼí]] communities. In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15–29 group, in which 27% of the Arab population is found, and the age 30–44 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population.&lt;ref name=&quot;demographics&quot;/&gt;

Haifa is the center of liberal Arabic-speaking culture, as it was under British colonial rule. The Arabic-speaking neighborhoods, which are mixed Muslim and Christian, are in the lowlands near the sea, while Jewish neighborhoods are at higher elevation. An active Arab cultural life has developed in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=NYT01416&gt;{{cite news |last=Hadid |first=Diaa |title=In Israeli City of Haifa, a Liberal Palestinian Culture Blossoms |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/world/middleeast/in-israeli-city-of-haifa-a-liberal-palestinian-culture-blossoms.html |accessdate=4 January 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haifa is situated on the [[Israeli coastal plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]], the [[Via Maris|historic land bridge]] between Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the mouth of the Kishon River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=1504 |title=Haifa, Israel |publisher=Timeanddate.com |accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the northern slopes of [[Mount Carmel]] and around [[Haifa Bay]], the city is split over three tiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Euk/Destinations/Haifa/general+info.htm |title=Haifa – General info |accessdate=20 March 2008 |publisher=Israeli Ministry of Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest is the center of commerce and industry including the [[Port of Haifa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tiers&quot; /&gt; The middle level is on the slopes of Mount Carmel and consists of older residential neighborhoods, while the upper level consists of modern neighborhoods looking over the lower tiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiers&quot; /&gt; From here views can be had across the [[Western Galilee]] region of Israel towards [[Rosh HaNikra, Israel|Rosh HaNikra]] and the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Lebanese border]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tiers&quot; /&gt; Haifa is about {{convert|90|km|mi|1|sp=us}} north of the city of [[Tel Aviv]], and has a large number of beaches on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goisrael.com/NR/rdonlyres/FAEF9852-0C3C-43CD-B751-BE0C4A977000/5304/RoadDistanceChart1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Road Distances Chart|publisher=Israel Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=20 March 2008|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409211830/http://www.goisrael.com/NR/rdonlyres/FAEF9852-0C3C-43CD-B751-BE0C4A977000/5304/RoadDistanceChart1.pdf|archivedate=9 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The Carmel Mountain has three main [[wadi]]s: Lotem, Amik and Si'ach. For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, [[golden jackal]], [[hyrax]], [[Egyptian mongoose]], [[owls]] and chameleons.

==Climate==
Haifa has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761575008___2/israel.html |title=Israel |accessdate=20 March 2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028171259/http://encarta.msn.com/text_761575008___2/Israel.html|archivedate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring arrives in March when temperatures begin to increase. By late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. The average temperature in summer is {{convert|26|°C|°F|0|sp=us}} and in winter, {{convert|12|°C|°F|0|sp=us}}. Snow is rare in Haifa, but temperatures around {{convert|3|°C|°F|0|sp=us}} can sometimes occur, usually in the early morning. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between September and May. Annual precipitation is approximately {{convert|629|mm|in|0|sp=us}}.

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Israel - Haifa - view 001.jpg|thumb|[[Bat Galim]] neighborhood and [[Haifa Bay]]]]
[[File:Haifa 3082-1.jpg|thumb|Panorama Towers]]
Haifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is [[Wadi Salib]], the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for [[Government Buildings|government buildings]]. Wadi Salib stretches across to [[Wadi Nisnas]], the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the [[German Colony, Haifa|German Colony]] was built, providing the first model of [[urban planning]] in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiers&quot; /&gt;

The first buildings in [[Hadar HaCarmel|Hadar]] were constructed at the start of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa's cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around Haifa's Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately halfway up Mount Carmel, around the German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Wadi Salib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/viehaifa.html |title=Haifa |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city's older neighborhoods.

[[Neve Sha'anan, Haifa|Neve Sha'anan]], a neighborhood located on the second tier of Mount Carmel, was founded in the 1920s.

In 2012, a new, massive development plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western section of the city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The west side of the port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |title=Plan aims to turn Haifa into 'the Barcelona of Israel' |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A park will be developed on the border of the [[Kishon River]], the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port to the rest of the city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center.&lt;ref name=hotels/&gt; In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4330877,00.html |title=Move of Haifa Bay's ammonia tank tangled in red tape |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another plan seeks to turn the western section of Haifa Port into a major tourism and nightlife center, as well as a functioning point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel. All port activity will be moved to the western side, and the area will be redeveloped. Public spaces and a beach promenade will be developed, and commercial buildings will be renovated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |title=Plan aims to turn Haifa into 'the Barcelona of Israel' |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the development plans, the [[Israeli Navy]], which has a large presence in Haifa, will withdraw from the shoreline between [[Bat Galim]] and Hof Hashaket. A {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[esplanade]] which will encircle the shoreline will be constructed. It will include a bicycle path, and possibly also a small bridge under which navy vessels will pass on their way to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4312236,00.html|title=Haifa residents invited to 'smash wall' |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a 50,000 square-meter entertainment complex that will contain a [[Disney]] theme park, cinemas, shops, and a 25-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex theater]] will be built at the Check Post exit from the Carmel Tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000612861&amp;fid=1124 |title=NIS 600m Disney park, multiplex planned for Haifa |work=Globes |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-haifa-outline-plan-filed-for-objections-1000920431 |title=Haifa outline plan filed for objections |work=Globes |date=26 February 2014 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a new plan for the city was approved. The plan included a new main downtown business district, the creation of a park in a current industrial area, new construction and renovation of public buildings and hubs of higher education, tourism, culture, commerce, leisure, and residence.&lt;ref name=globes /&gt;

==Government==
As an industrial port city, Haifa has traditionally been a [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor party]] stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and [[trade union]]s earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the [[Communist Party of Israel|Israeli Communist Party]], among them [[Tawfik Toubi]], [[Emile Habibi]], [[Zahi Karkabi]], [[Bulus Farah]] and [[Emile Toma]], were from Haifa. [[File:Haifa Courts.jpg|thumb|left|Haifa court building]]In recent years, there has been a drift toward the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/2005/12/13haifa |title=Haifa through the looking glass |accessdate=23 January 2008 |date=13 December 2005 |publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-20132871.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405160340/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-20132871.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2012 |title='Red Haifa' in revolt against Labor |accessdate=23 January 2008 |publisher=Highbeam Research – Originally from [[The Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post]] |date=1 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicpluralism.org/articles/2006a/mysteriessafed.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081007/http://www.islamicpluralism.org/articles/2006a/mysteriessafed.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=The Mysteries of Safed, The Banners of Haifa, |date=26 July 2006 |first=Stephen |last=Schwartz |accessdate=23 January 2008 |publisher=Islampluralism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was best signified by, in [[2006 Israeli legislative election|the 2006 legislative elections]], the [[Kadima]] party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3233587,00.html |title=Haifa 2006 election results |work=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |accessdate=23 January 2008 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before 1948, Haifa's Municipality was fairly unusual as it developed cooperation between the mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city, with representatives of both groups involved in the city's management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the [[city council]] had six Arab and two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under [[Hasan Bey Shukri]], who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eyadat |first=Fadi |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1150667.html |title=Haifa honors first mayor's legacy of coexistence |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, [[Shabtai Levy]], was elected. Levy's two deputies were Arab (one Muslim, the other Christian), with the remainder of the council made up of four Jews and six Arabs.&lt;ref name=&quot;govt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kUOK3a6hAMsC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=haifa+municipality |title=Mixed Towns, Trapped Communities: Historical Narratives, Spatial Dynamics |last=Daniel Monterescu |first=Dan Rabinowitz |pages=113–132 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |accessdate=26 July 2009 |isbn=978-0-7546-4732-4 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Haifa is governed by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor [[Einat Kalisch-Rotem]]. The results of municipal elections decide on the makeup of the council, similarly to the [[Knesset]] elections. The city council is the legislative council in the city, and has the authority to pass auxiliary laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;council main&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haifa.muni.il/Cultures/he-IL/Municipality/Management/CityCouncil/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117042303/http://www.haifa.muni.il/Cultures/he-IL/Municipality/Management/CityCouncil/|archivedate=17 January 2008|title=City Council Overview|language=Hebrew|publisher=Haifa Municipality}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th council, which was elected in 2003, has 31 members, with the liberal [[Shinui]]-[[The Greens (Israel)|Greens]] ticket holding the most seats (6), and [[Likud]] coming second with 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;council members&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haifa.muni.il/Cultures/he-IL/Municipality/Management/CityCouncil/members.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117045014/http://www.haifa.muni.il/Cultures/he-IL/Municipality/Management/CityCouncil/members.htm |archivedate=17 January 2008|title=Members of the 12th City Council|language=Hebrew|publisher=Haifa Municipality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the decisions passed by the city council are results of recommendation made by the various municipal committees, which are committees where non-municipal organs meet with representatives from the city council.

==Education==
Haifa is home to two internationally acclaimed universities and several colleges. The [[University of Haifa]], founded in 1963, is at the top of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of [[Brasília]] and [[United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a panoramic view of northern Israel. The [[Hecht Museum]], with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.

The [[Technion|Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]], described as Israel's [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], was founded in 1912. It has 18 faculties and 42 [[research institute]]s. The original building now houses Haifa's [[science museum]]. The [[Hebrew Reali School]] was founded in 1913. It is the largest [[k-12]] school in Israel, with 4,000 students in 7 branches, all over the city. The first technological high school in Israel, Bosmat, was established in Haifa in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/894017.html |title=The closing of a dream come true |accessdate=25 January 2008 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other academic institutions in Haifa are the [[Gordon College of Education]] and Sha'anan Religious Teachers' College, the [[WIZO Haifa Academy of Design and Education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wizodzn.ac.il/article.asp?cc=01031805 |title=A Cross-Section of Israeli Reality, Here and Now |publisher=Wizodzn.ac.il |date=22 September 2006 |accessdate=24 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514150810/http://wizodzn.ac.il/article.asp?cc=01031805 |archivedate=14 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tiltan College of Design. The Michlala Leminhal College of Management and the [[Open University of Israel]] have branches in Haifa. The city also has a nursing college and the P.E.T Practical Engineering School.&lt;ref name=&quot;edu&quot; /&gt;

{{As of|2006}}–07, Haifa had 70 [[Primary education|elementary schools]], 23 [[middle school]]s, 28 academic [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]]s and 8 vocational high schools. There were 5,133 pupils in municipal kindergartens, 20,081 in elementary schools, 7,911 in middle schools, 8,072 in academic high schools, 2,646 in vocational high schools, and 2,068 in comprehensive district high schools. 86% of the students attended Hebrew-speaking schools and 14% attended Arab schools. 5% were in [[special education]].&lt;ref name=&quot;edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.haifa.muni.il/spru/doc/YB/Education/Y2007/Download/EducationDL.pdf |format=PDF|title=Education |accessdate=14 February 2008 |date=1 June 2007 |publisher=Haifa Municipality |work=Haifa Statistical Yearbook 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226230026/http://www1.haifa.muni.il/spru/doc/YB/Education/Y2007/Download/EducationDL.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Haifa had 16 municipal libraries stocking 367,323 books.&lt;ref name=&quot;leisure&quot; /&gt; Two prestigious Arab schools in Haifa are the Orthodox School, run by the Greek Orthodox church, and the Nazareth Nuns' School, a Catholic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ratner |first=David |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/haifa-s-christian-schools-lead-the-league-1.123464 |title=Haifa's Christian schools lead the league |work=Haaretz |date=25 May 2004 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===
[[File:Haifa cable car.jpg|thumb|A [[Aerial lift|Cable Car]] descending from [[Mount Carmel]] to [[Bat Galim]]]]
Haifa is served by six [[Rail transport|railway]] stations and the [[Carmelit]], currently Israel's only [[Rapid transit|subway]] system (another is planned in Tel Aviv). The [[Nahariya]]–[[Tel Aviv]] [[Coastal railway line, Israel|Coastal Railway]] main line of [[Israel Railways]] runs along the coast of the [[Haifa Bay|Gulf of Haifa]] and has six stations within the city. From south-west to north-east, these stations are: [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Railway Station|Haifa Hof HaCarmel]], [[Haifa Bat Galim Railway Station|Haifa Bat Galim]], [[Haifa Center HaShmona Railway Station|Haifa Merkaz HaShmona]], [[HaMifrats Central Railway Station|HaMifrats Central]], [[Hutzot HaMifratz Railway Station|Hutzot HaMifratz]] and [[Kiryat Haim Railway Station|Kiryat Haim]]. Together with the [[Kiryat Motzkin Railway Station]] in the northern suburb [[Kiryat Motzkin]], they form the Haifa – Krayot suburban line (&quot;Parvarit&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israrail.org.il/english/travel/map.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301032459/http://www.israrail.org.il/english/travel/map.html |archivedate=1 March 2007 |title=Railway Map |publisher=Israel Railways |accessdate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are direct trains from Haifa to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], [[Nahariya]], [[Acre, Israel|Akko]], [[Kiryat Motzkin]], [[Binyamina]], [[Lod]], [[Ramla]], [[Beit Shemesh]], [[Jerusalem]] and other locations, but all trains to Beersheba skips all Haifa stations.

Haifa's [[Bus|intercity bus]] connections are operated almost exclusively by the [[Egged (company)|Egged]] bus company, which operates two terminals:
* [[HaMifratz Central Bus Station]], adjacent to the [[HaMifrats Central Railway Station]]
* [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station]], adjacent to the [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Railway Station|Hof HaCarmel Railway Station]]
Lines to the North of the country use [[HaMifratz Central Bus Station]] and their coverage includes most towns in the North of Israel. Lines heading south use [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station]]. [[File:Haifa-09-Carmelit.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Carmelit]], currently Israel's only subway]]Destinations directly reachable from Hof HaCarmel CBS include [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Eilat]], [[Ra'anana|Raanana]], [[Netanya]], [[Hadera]], [[Zikhron Ya'akov]], [[Atlit]], [[Tirat Carmel]], [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and intermediate communities. There are also three Egged lines that have their terminus in the [[Ramat Vizhnitz]] neighborhood and run to [[Jerusalem]], [[Bnei Brak]] and [[Ashdod]]. These used to be &quot;''[[mehadrin bus lines|mehadrin]]''&quot; (i.e. gender segregated) lines.

All urban lines are run by Egged. There are also [[share taxi]]s that run along some bus routes but do not have an official schedule. In 2006, Haifa implemented a trial network of neighborhood mini-buses – named &quot;Shkhunatit&quot; and run by [[Egged (company)|Egged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885952889&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Egged to start minibus project in Haifa|work=[[The Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post]]|date=9 June 2006|accessdate=22 February 2008|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718110005/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885952889&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, [[GetTaxi]], an app and taxi service which allows users to hail a cab using their smartphone without contacting the taxi station (by identifying and summoning the closest taxi) began operating.

[[File:Metronit track.jpg|thumb|Completed [[Metronit]] track in downtown Haifa]]
Haifa and the [[Krayot (Haifa)|Krayot]] suburbs also have a new [[Phileas (public transport)|Phileas concept]] [[bus rapid transit]] system called the [[Metronit]]. These buses, operating with [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] engines, follow optical strips embedded in designated lanes of roads, providing tram-like public transportation services. The Metronit consists of 100 18-meter buses, each with the capacity for 150 passengers, operating along {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} of designated roadways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Friedman |first=Ron |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Haifa-to-get-new-Metronit-Bus-Rapid-Transit-system-by-2011 |title=Haifa to get new 'Metronit' Bus Rapid Transit system by 2011 &amp;#124; JPost &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date= |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yefenof.co.il/pages/lighTrain.php|title=Metronit|publisher=Yefenof.co.il |accessdate=22 February 2008 |language=Hebrew |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080221164200/http://www.yefenof.co.il/pages/lighTrain.php |archivedate = 21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system officially opened on 16 August 2013 serving three lines.

Since the summer of 2008, night buses are operated by Egged in Haifa (line 200) and the [[Krayot (Haifa)|Krayot]] suburbs (line 210).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egged.co.il/Eng/Main.asp?lngCategoryID=6100|title=Night buses in Haifa &amp; Krayot at the Egged official website|accessdate=19 November 2008|publisher=[[Egged (company)|Egged]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2008 these lines operated 7 nights a week. Since 2013, along with route 1 of the Metronit, they operate 7 nights a week, making Haifa as the only city in Israel with 24/7 public transportation. Haifa is also the only city in Israel to operate a Saturday bus service to the beaches during summer time. Egged lines run during Saturday mornings from many neighborhoods to the [[Dado Beach|Dado]] and [[Bat Galim]] beaches, and back in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egged.co.il/Eng/Main.asp?lngCategoryID=6096|title=Summer routes to the beaches at the Egged official website|accessdate=20 November 2008|publisher=[[Egged (company)|Egged]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Port of Haifa 2752-1.jpg|thumb|The [[Port of Haifa]]]]

The Haifa underground railway system is called [[Carmelit]]. It is a subterranean [[funicular]] on rails, running from downtown Paris Square to Gan HaEm (Mother's Park) on [[Mount Carmel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/c10/159|title=The Carmelit|accessdate=19 February 2008|publisher=Tour-Haifa.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a single track, six stations and two trains, it is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's shortest metro line. The Carmelit accommodates bicycles.

Haifa also has a [[Aerial lift|cable car]]. The [[Cable cars in Haifa|Haifa Cable Car]] [[gondola lift]] consists of six cabins and connects [[Bat Galim]] on the coast to the [[Stella Maris Monastery|Stella Maris]] [[Deck (building)|observation deck]] and monastery atop [[Mount Carmel]]. It serves mainly tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bazlov/israel/haifa.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119220607/http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bazlov/israel/haifa.html |archivedate=19 January 2008 |title=Haifa |publisher=[[Weizmann Institute of Science|Weizmann Institute]] |accessdate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are currently plans to add a 4.4 kilometre commuter cable car service to Haifa's [[public transport]] system, running from [[HaMifratz Central Bus Station]] at the foot of Mount Carmel to the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]], and then to the [[University of Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.haifa.muni.il/apps/project/infrastructure/cablemifratz.asp |title=אתר עיריית חיפה – פרוייקטים |publisher=.haifa.muni.il |accessdate=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618062954/http://www1.haifa.muni.il/apps/project/Infrastructure/cablemifratz.asp |archivedate=18 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air and sea transport===
[[Haifa Airport]] serves domestic flights to [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Eilat]] as well as international charters to [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]] and [[Jordan]]. The airliners that operate flights from Haifa are [[Arkia]] and [[Israir]]. There are currently plans to expand services from Haifa.
