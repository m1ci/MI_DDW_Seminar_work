Fisting may be performed without a partner, but it is most often a partnered activity.

==History==
Fisting's emergence as a popular sexual practice is commonly attributed to gay male culture and it may not have existed until the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damousi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joy |last1=Damousi |first2=Robert |last2=Reynolds|title=History on the Couch: Essays in History and Psychoanalysis|publisher=[[Melbourne University]]|isbn=052285057X|year=2003|page=57|accessdate=February 24, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9NIWYP7MmkC&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bergman|title=The Violet Hour: The Violet Quill and the Making of Gay Culture|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=0231503830|year=2004|pages=206–207|accessdate=February 24, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yam1zo4yUlsC&amp;pg=PA206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piontek|first=Thomas|title=Queering Gay and Lesbian Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AGKA8l9ADYC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=October 9, 2014|date=January 2006|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|isbn=978-0-252-03031-4|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Morgan Lawrence]], a [[sex educator]], however, believes the practice dates back thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taormino |first=T. |date=1998 |title=The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wE4gAQAAIAAJ |location=Page 103 |publisher= |page= |isbn=9781573440288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous fisting club in the world was the [[Catacombs (fisting club)|Catacombs]], located in [[San Francisco]], which operated during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;occupytampa.org&quot;&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]], &quot;The Catacombs: A Triumph of the Butthole&quot;, in ''Leatherfolk: Radical Sex, People, Politics, and Practice'', Alyson Press, 1992, {{ISBN|1555831877}}, pp. 119-141; reprinted in ''Deviations: A Gayle Rubin Reader'', Duke University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|0822349868}}, {{cite web|url=http://occupytampa.org/files/tristan/introfem/final/introfem%20final%20final/Gayle_S._Rubin_Deviations_A_Gayle_Rubin_Reader_a_John_Hope_Franklin_Center_Book__2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082917/http://occupytampa.org/files/tristan/introfem/final/introfem%20final%20final/Gayle_S._Rubin_Deviations_A_Gayle_Rubin_Reader_a_John_Hope_Franklin_Center_Book__2011.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}, retrieved September 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Handball Express]] was another such club.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Rofes, ''A Walking Tour of South of Market in the 1970s'', San Francisco, 2005, pp. 16-17, {{cite web |url=http://www.ericrofes.com/pdf/70s_Walking_Tour.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031170033/http://www.ericrofes.com/pdf/70s_Walking_Tour.pdf |archivedate=October 31, 2014 }}, retrieved September 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crisco]] was commonly used as a lubricant, before more specialized [[personal lubricant]]s became available.

In the 1980s, it was assumed that unprotected fisting—which often produces small injuries to the anus, permitting microorganisms access to the blood—was an easy route for transmission of HIV. This, combined with sexual squeamishness towards the public fisting culture in gay establishments of San Francisco, led gay writer [[Randy Shilts]] to successfully campaign for the closure of venues, such as [[gay bathhouses]] and sex clubs, that openly permitted it.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle S.

The [[San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley]] consists of four works of art along Ringold Alley honoring [[leather subculture|leather culture]]; it opened in 2017.&lt;ref name=A&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/ringold-alleys-leather-memoir.html|title=Reginold Alley's Leather Memoir|author=Cindy|date=July 17, 2017|website=Public Art and Architecture from Around the World|publisher=Art and Architecture|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paull |first=Laura |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2018/06/21/honoring-gay-leather-culture-with-art-installation-in-soma-alleyway/ |title=Honoring gay leather culture with art installation in SoMa alleyway – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= June 21, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the works of art is metal bootprints along the curb which honor 28 people who were an important part of the leather communities of San Francisco; those honored include Steve McEachern, owner of the fisting club the [[Catacombs (sex club)|Catacombs]], and Bert Herman, leader of the fisting community, author, and publisher.&lt;ref name=A&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish&quot;/&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:Silentduck.jpg|right|thumb|The beak-like &quot;silent duck&quot; used in the initial stages of fisting]]
[[File:fisting close-up.jpg|thumb|Vaginal insertion]]
[[File:four fingers.jpg|thumb|Four fingers inside of the vulva]]
The &quot;Silent Duck&quot;, also called &quot;Duck-Billing&quot;, is the technique often used in which the person engaging in hand insertion shapes the hand to resemble a duck's beak. Typically, fisting does not involve forcing the clenched fist into the vagina or rectum; this is a practice called &quot;punching&quot;. Instead, all five fingers are kept straight and held as close together as possible (forming the [[beak]]-like &quot;duck&quot;), then slowly inserted into a well lubricated vagina or rectum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrman&quot;/&gt;

In more vigorous forms of fisting, such as &quot;punching&quot; or &quot;punchfisting&quot;, a fully clenched fist may be inserted and withdrawn slowly.

Fistees who are more experienced may take two fists (double-fisting). In the case of double-fisting, pleasure is derived more from the stretching of the [[anus]] or [[vagina]] than from the [[thrust]]ing (in-and-out) movement of hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrman&quot;/&gt;

==Risks==
Fisting can cause [[laceration]] or [[organ perforation|perforation]] of the [[vagina]], [[perineum]], [[rectum]], or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], resulting in serious injury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=C.

Anal fisting carries risks of [[colorectal perforation]]; participants are advised to use [[latex gloves]] and lubricant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyk|first=Alta C.

The practice, along with the insertion of hard objects into the anus, has been significantly related to the traumatization of the rectal mucosa in increasing the likelihood of infection, including [[Hepatitis B virus|Hepatitis B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Auerbach|first=Judith|title=AIDS and Behavior: An Integrated Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wq7fSNgUZKQC|accessdate=March 4, 2014|date=January 15, 1994|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-05093-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
{{globalize|date=April 2015}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] fisting is legal to perform;&lt;ref name=&quot;extreme-porn-trial&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Myles Jackman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/aug/08/extreme-porn-trial-simon-walsh |title=Extreme porn trial: consensual sex and the state &amp;#124; Myles Jackman &amp;#124; Law &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |newspaper=Guardian |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=January 4, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] considers publication of fisting material to be grounds for prosecution under the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obscene publications: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/obscene_publications/#a05|accessdate=August 27, 2014|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the CPS's guidance, in the case of [[R v Peacock]] in 2012, Michael Peacock was found not guilty of breaching the Obscene Publications Act for selling DVDs containing anal fisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/07/obscene-publications-act-future-doubt |title=Obscenity law in doubt after jury acquits distributor of gay pornography |newspaper=The Guardian |author1=Beaumont, Peter  |author2=Hodgson, Nichi |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |date=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an unsuccessful [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008#2012 test case|extreme pornography prosecution in 2012]] where it was argued by the prosecution that images of anal fisting constitute [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|extreme pornography]] and thus are illegal to possess because the act is &quot;likely to result in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;extreme-porn-trial&quot;/&gt;
,
In the [[United States]], according to attorney Allan Gelbard there is nothing &quot;per se illegal&quot; about any pornography so long as it is not [[child pornography]], however, it can be found to be [[United States obscenity law|obscene]]. Fisting is on the [[Cambria List]], a list of sex acts which may be prosecutable under U.S. obscenity law, created by lawyer [[Paul Cambria]] in 2001. The list is intended to act as guidelines to help producers avoid obscenity lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/fisting-taboo-law/|title=Is fisting the Internet's last taboo sex act?|date=October 21, 2014|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=March 3, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
