It is the capital and largest city of the judicial and administrative [[arrondissement of Kortrijk]]. The wider municipality comprises the city of Kortrijk proper and the villages of [[Aalbeke]], [[Bellegem]], [[Bissegem]], [[Heule]], [[Kooigem]], [[Marke (Belgium)|Marke]], and [[Rollegem]].  Kortrijk is also part of the cross-border [[Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai]] metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;List of municipalities : http://fr.eurometropolis.eu/qui-sommes-nous/territoire.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurometropolis.eu|title=EUROMETROPOLIS : Eurometropolis Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai, the 1st European cross-bordrer metropolis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kortrijk - Beguinage and Sint-Maartenskerk.jpg|thumb|[[Beguinage]] of Kortrijk]]

Kortrijk originated from a Gallo-Roman town, ''Cortoriacum''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites, CORTORIACUM (Courtrai) Belgium.| accessdate = 2018-06-08| url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=cortoriacum}}&lt;/ref&gt;, at a crossroads near the Leie river and two Roman roads. In the [[Middle Ages]], Kortrijk grew significantly thanks to the [[flax]] and [[wool]] industry with France and England and became one of the biggest and richest cities in [[Flanders]]. The city is often referred to as City of Groeninge or City of the Golden Spurs, referring to the Battle of Courtrai or the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] which took place on 11 July 1302 on the [[Groeninge Monument|Fields of Groeninge]] in Kortrijk. In 1820 the [[Treaty of Kortrijk]] was signed, laying out the still-current borders between France and Belgium. Throughout the 19th and 20th century, the flax industry flourished and remains important within the Belgian textile industry today.

Kortrijk is the largest city in southern West Flanders, with several hospitals, colleges and [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Kulak|a university]]. Kortrijk was the first city in Belgium with a pedestrian shopping street, the ''Korte Steenstraat''.

== History ==
===Name===
The Roman name ''Cortoriacum''&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites, CORTORIACUM (Courtrai) Belgium.| accessdate = 2018-06-08| url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=cortoriacum}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant in Latin, the settlement near the curb in the river.{{Citation needed|reason=Latin translation |date=June 2018}} There is also mention of 'Cortoracum' in some literature. Its name later evolved to 'Cortrycke', 'Cortryck' and 'Kortrijk' (19th Century). The French call it Courtrai.

=== Origins Roman times ===
Findings from an archeological dig in 1950 in which remains of three Roman [[funeral pyre]]s were found&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-archeo.be/rapporten/217_Kortrijk_Morinnestraat/217%20Rapport%20Kortrijk%20-%20Morinnestraat.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the [[vicus]] was used as an encampment by the Romans during their [[Roman conquest of Britain|invasion of Britain in 43 CE]].

''Cortoriacum'' was a larger [[Gallo-Roman]] [[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]] of [[civitas]] [[menapii|Menapiorum]] at an important crossroads near the [[Lys_(river)|Lys]] river of the Roman roads linking [[Tongeren]] and [[Cassel, France|Cassel]] and [[Tournai]] and [[Oudenburg]]. It was first mentioned in a document from the 4th or 5th century called [[Notitia Dignitatum]] where the Cortoriacenses (Cavalry)Troops were mentioned. In the 9th century, [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]] established fortifications against the [[Vikings]].  The town gained its [[Municipal charter|city charter]] in 1190 from [[Philip, Count of Flanders]].  The population growth required new [[defensive walls]], part of which can still be seen today (the [[Broeltorens]], [[Armory, Kortrijk]]). Several local places still refer to physical parts of the defensive structures around Kortrijk (Walle, Waterpoort, Menenpoort, Gentsepoort, Brugsepoort, Kasteelkaai); Most of the physical parts have been overbuilt or destroyed.

[[File:Bourgondisch kasteel.jpg|thumb|left|The second castle of Kortrijk]]
In the 13th century, the battles between [[Infante Fernando, Count of Flanders|Fernando of Portugal, Count of Flanders]] and his first cousin, King [[Louis VIII of France]], led to the destruction of the city.  The Counts of Flanders had it rebuilt soon after. To promote industry and weaving in the town, [[Joan, Countess of Flanders]] exempted settlers in Kortrijk from [[property tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Fegley, 124&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, Kortrijk gained great importance as a center of [[linen]] production.

=== Battle of the Golden Spurs ===
{{main article|Battle of the Golden Spurs}}
In 1302, the population of [[Bruges]] started a successful uprising against the French, who had annexed [[Flanders (county)|Flanders]] a couple of years earlier.  On 18 May the French population in that city was massacred, an event that could not go unpunished.  The famous ensuing [[Battle of Courtrai (1302)|Battle of Courtrai]] in 1302, also known as the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] (Dutch: ''Guldensporenslag''), between the [[Flemings|Flemish people]], mostly commoners and farmers, and [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair’s]] knights took place near Kortrijk on 11 July, resulting in a victory for Flanders;&lt;ref name=Ch1906&gt;[https://archive.org/details/chamberssconcise00patruoft Courtrai (Flem. Kortrijk), a walled town of Belgium, on the Lys, 54 miles SW. of Brussels by rail, and 6 from the French frontier. It has a fine eld bridge flanked with towers, a noble townhall (1526), belfry, and a beautiful Gothic church, founded in 1238 by Baldwin, Count of Flanders. Table damask, linen, and lace are the chief manufactures. Population, about 35,000. Here, in 1302, the citizens of Ghent and Bruges won over the French the 'Battle of the Spurs,' so named from the number of gilt spurs gathered from the dead. ''Chambers's Concise Gazetteer Of The World'', by David Patrick. W. &amp; R. Chambers, Limited, 1906.]&lt;/ref&gt; the date is now commemorated as a national holiday by the whole [[Flemish community]].

Following a new uprising by the Flemish in 1323, this time against their own [[Louis I, Count of Flanders|Count Louis I]], the French invaded again.  These Flemish acquisitions were consolidated by the French at the [[Battle of Cassel (1328)]].

Louis I’s son [[Louis II of Flanders|Louis II]] lost the city to a Flemish uprising led by [[Philip van Artevelde]] in 1381, but the Flemish were later decisively defeated at the 1382 [[Battle of Roosebeke]] by Louis II with French support, resulting in a new wave of plundering and destruction.

=== 15th century to modern times ===
Most of the 15th century was prosperous under the [[Dukes of Burgundy]], until the death of the Burgundian heiress, [[Mary of Burgundy]], in 1482, which ushered in renewed fighting with France.

The 16th century was marked by the confrontations engendered by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the uprising of the Netherlands against Spain.

[[Louis XIV]]’s reign saw Kortrijk occupied by the French five times in sixty years and its former fortifications razed. The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] finally assigned the whole area to Austria.

After the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleon]]ic era, the textile industry, based on [[flax]], and the general economy of the city could finally prosper again.

Kortrijk was heavily bombed in the summer of 1917, but [[Battle of Courtrai (1918)|was liberated]] by the British Army the following year. During World War II the city was an important railway hub for the German army, and for this reason was the target of several allied air-strikes. On 21 July 1944 (the Belgian National Day) around 300 [[Avro Lancasters]] dropped over 5,000 bombs on the city center.&lt;ref&gt;From De Standaard 17/07/09 ''Kortrijk is bombardement na 65 jaar nog niet vergeten''&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical buildings on the central square, as well as the old railway station, were destroyed.

=== Battle of Courtrai===
Battles fought there in 1302, 1580, 1793, 1794, 1814, 1815, and 1918 have each been called [[Battle of Courtrai (disambiguation)|Battle of Courtrai]]

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Kortrijk lies at the intersection of three highways:
* The [[European route E17|E17]]: connects Kortrijk with [[Ghent]], [[Sint-Niklaas]] and [[Antwerp]] to the northeast, and with [[Lille]] and [[Paris]] to the south-west.
* The [[European route E403|E403]]: connects Kortrijk with [[Bruges]] and [[Ostend]] to the north, and with [[Tournai]], [[Mons]] and [[Charleroi]] to the south-east.
* The Belgian highway A19: connects Kortrijk with [[Ypres]] and the Belgian coast.
* In addition Kortrijk also has two ringways:
** The R8: connects the outskirts of Kortrijk with each other and the surrounding villages, and also leads to the A19, [[European route E403|E403]] and [[European route E17|E17]] roads.
** The R36: connects the different downtown quarters with each other, and provides access to the main avenues.

=== Railway ===
* The municipality of Kortrijk has two railway stations:
** [[Kortrijk main railway station]]: an international railway station with direct connections to [[Brugge railway station|Brugge Centraal (Bruges)]], [[Brussel Zuid]], [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Poperinge]] and [[Ieper railway station|Ieper (Ypres)]], [[Oudenaarde]], other Belgian towns and [[Gare de Lille-Flandres|Lille]] in France.  The station also offers a direct connection to [[Brussels Airport]].
** Bissegem Station: a regional railway station in the village of Bissegem with connections to Ypres.

=== Public city transport ===
Kortrijk has an extensive web of public transport lines, operated by ''[[De Lijn]]'', providing access to the city centre and the suburbs (city lines, {{lang-nl|stadslijnen}}) and to many towns and villages in the region around the city (regional lines, {{lang-nl|streeklijnen}}).
* ''City buses'':
** Line 1: Station – [[Kortrijk Xpo]] – [[Kinepolis]] – Leiedal
** Line 2: Station – Lange Munte
** Line 4: Station – Bissegem Station – Heule Kransvijver
** Line 50: Station – Kuurne Seizoenswijk

* ''Regional buses''
:At [[Kortrijk main railway station]], there is a bus station where regional buses stop as well.

=== Airport ===
[[File:StartbaanKortrijkAirport.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport|Kortrijk Airport]].]]
* The city has an airport known as [[Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport]], which is mainly used for business travel and medical flights. Kortrijk Airport is located northwest of the citycentre, next to the R8 ringroad.
* The national [[Brussels Airport]], one hour away by train or car, offers the best international connectivity.
* The [[Lille Lesquin International Airport]] is located 35 kilometres from Kortrijk.

=== Waterways ===
[[File:Kortrijk - Brug over Leie.jpg|thumb|right|New Groeningebridge and Albertpark.]]
The [[Lys_(river)|river Lys]] (Leie) is an important way of transporting goods through [[inland navigation]]. The [[Bossuit-Kortrijk Canal]] enables in the city centre a direct connection with the river [[Scheldt]]. 

Within the City, the river briefly splits in two, to re-join about a mile further. 
* ''Oude Leie'' (''Old Lys'') original southernmost riverbed where the ''Broel'' towers still stand.
* ''Nieuwe Leie'' (''New Lys'') New bed that was dug around 1585 by Humans to accommodate water powered equipment {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Brill Archive| last = AC02717376| first = Anonymus| title = Acta Historiae Neerlandica| date = 1966}} p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s on, the planning and later the execution of the so-called ''Leiewerken'' (''Leieworks'') started. These construction works comprised the deepening and widening of the river. This would enable ships with 4400&amp;nbsp;tons to navigate from France to the Scheldt. At the same time, this project included a thorough urban renewal of the riversides in the city. Seven new bridges were to give a new architectural impulse to the river quarters as well as the construction of several new parks along the river.

The following bridges were built during the period of 1997 and 2012:
* ''Dambrug''
* ''Groeningebrug'' near the ''AlbertPark''
* ''Ronde van Vlaanderenbrug'' near the new ''Nelson Mandelapark'' 
* ''Collegebrug'' referring to the ''St Amands'' college
* ''Noordbrug'' (2010)
* ''Budabrug''
