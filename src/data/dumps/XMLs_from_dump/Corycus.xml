'''Corycus''' ({{lang-el|Κώρυκος}}; also [[transliterated]] '''Corycos''' or '''Korykos'''; {{lang-hy|Կոռիկոս|translit=Koṙikos}}; {{lang-tr|Kız Kalesi}}, [[Literal translation|lit.]] &quot;maiden castle&quot;) was an ancient city in [[Cilicia Trachaea]], [[Anatolia]], located at the mouth of the valley called Şeytan deresi; the site is now occupied by the town of [[Kızkalesi]] (formerly Ghorgos), [[Mersin Province]], [[Turkey]].

==The city==

[[Strabo]] does not mention a town of Corycus, but reports a promontory so called at the location, but a town Corycus is mentioned by [[Livy]] (xxxiii. 20), and by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (v. 27), and [[Pomponius Mela]] (i. 13), and [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (s. v. Κώρυκος). In antiquity, Corycus was an important harbor and commercial town. It was the port of [[Silifke|Seleucia]], where, in 191 BCE, the fleet of [[Antiochus the Great]] was defeated by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. In the Roman times it preserved its ancient laws; the emperors usually kept a fleet there to watch over the pirates. Corycus was also a mint in antiquity and some of its coins survive.

Corycus was controlled by the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;edwards&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W., &quot;Korykos&quot; |title=The Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Early Christian Art and Archaeology, ed., Paul Corby Finney |date=2016 |publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing| location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8028-9017-7| pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justinian I]] restored the public baths and a hospital. The admiral [[Eustathios Kymineianos]] re-fortified the island on the orders of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] at the beginning of the 12th century, adding a supplementary castle on a small island. This castle was later called &quot;maidens castle&quot;, because it was told that a king held his daughter here in captivity until she was killed by a venomous snake. It was prophesied she would die by a snake bite.  So she was taken to the sea castle to protect her, but a serpent was taken by basket to the castle, she was bitten and died. Corycus was conquered by the [[Armenia]]ns soon after it was rebuilt by the Byzantines.

Until the mid-14th century the Armenians held both the mainland and island castles, which guarded this strategic port for the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. Simon, the Baron of Koŕikos, attended the coronation of King [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Levon I]] in 1198/99. Subsequent Armenian nobles maintained authority in the area (with a few brief interruptions) until 1360, when Peter I, the King of Cyprus, removed the [[Mamelukes]] and assumed suzerainty. In the late 14th century it fell again to the Turks. From 1448 or 1454 it belonged alternately to the [[Karamanids]], the Egyptians, the Karamanids a second time, and finally to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Archaeological surveys published in 1982 and 1987 found that the Armenians maintained (with occasional repairs) the mainland castle’s simple Byzantine plan with its rectangular double walls, square towers, and two chapels, all of which were built with masonry taken from the nearby late antique city. The only original Armenian construction is one small chapel.&lt;ref name=&quot;edwards1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards| first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII | date=1987|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=161-67, 284, pls.123a-128b, 296b-296c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Robert W., “Ecclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: First Report, ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 36, 1982, pp.173-75, pls.38-42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kizkalesi (castle)]] on the island has the extensive remains of Armenian rebuilding. The island was once connected to the mainland fort by a breakwater.

[[File:LANGLOIS(1861) p243 - CHATEAU ARMENIEN DE GORGHIOS.jpg|thumbnail|450px|Views of the Fortress and ruins of the town (c. 1860)]]
The ruins of the city are extensive. Among them are a triumphal arch, a [[necropolis]] with a beautiful [[Christianity|Christian]] tomb, [[sarcophagi]], etc. The two medieval castles, one on the shore, the other in an islet, connected by a ruined pier, are partially preserved; the former was reputed impregnable. The walls of the castle on the mainland contain many pieces of columns; and a mole of great unhewn rocks projects from one angle of the fortress about a hundred yards across the bay. Three churches are also found, one decorated with frescoes. The walls of the ancient city may still be traced, and there appear to be sufficient remains to invite a careful examination of the spot.

==Bishopric==
The city figures in the ''[[Synecdemus]]'' of [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]], and in a ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' of about 840.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04402b.htm Siméon Vailhé, &quot;Corycus&quot; in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (New York 1908)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bishopric]] of Corycus was a [[suffragan]] of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Prima]], to which Corycus belonged. Of the bishops of the see, Germanus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381; Sallustius took part in the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431&lt;ref&gt;John Fulton, Index Canonum: The Greek Text, an English Translation, and a Complete Digest of the Entire Code of Canon Law of the Undivided Primitive Church (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 16 Sep 2014 page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[synod]] held in Tarsus in 434, and was represented at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] by his [[metropolitan bishop]] Theodorus, who signed the acts of the council on his behalf; Archelaus went to a synod called by [[Patriarch Menas of Constantinople]] in 536; Cyprianus was at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553; and Ioannes participated in the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 680 and the [[Trullan Council]] in 692. In the aftermath of the [[Fourth Crusade]], Corycus became the seat of [[Latin Church]] bishops, one of whom, named Gerardus, took part in a council at Antioch in 1136.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 879-882&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;435&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002716&amp;mediaType=application/pdf vol. 1], p.&amp;nbsp;210; [https://archive.org/stream/hierarchiacathol06eubeuoft#page/184/mode/1up vol. 6], pp.&amp;nbsp;184–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Rudt de Collenberg Wipertus, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-5110_1982_num_94_2_2669 ''Le royaume et l'Église de Chypre face au Grand Schisme (1378-1417) d'après les Registres des Archives du Vatican''], in ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]]'', t. 94, n° 2, 1982, pp.&amp;nbsp;638 e 652&lt;/ref&gt; No longer a residential bishopric, Corycus is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 874&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Armenian inscriptions that were discovered at the castles of Korykos were credited to its construction to [[Levon I of Armenia|Levon I]] and then to Hetum I.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, op. cit (supra, note 21), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corycian Cave==
In the Corycian Cave (now ''[[Cennet and Cehennem|Cennet ve Cehennem]]''), 20 stadia inland, says Strabo, the best [[crocus]] ([[saffron]]) grows. He describes this cave as a great hollow, of a circular form, surrounded by a margin of rock, on all sides of a considerable height; on descending into this cavity, the ground is found to be uneven and generally rocky, and it is filled with shrubs, both evergreen and cultivated; in some parts the saffron is cultivated: there is also a cave here which contains a large source, which pours forth a river of pure, pellucid water, but it immediately sinks into the earth, and flowing underground enters the sea: they call it the Bitter Water. [[Pomponius Mela]] (i.13) has a long description of the same place apparently from the same authority that Strabo followed, but more embellished. This place is probably on the top of the mountain above Corycus.

This place is famed in [[Greek mythology]]. It is the [[Cilicia]]n cave of [[Pindar]] (''Pythian Ode'' i. 31), and of [[Aeschylus]] (''Prom. Vinct.'' 350), and it is the lair of Zeus' fiercest opponent, the monster [[Typhon]] or Typhoeus.
