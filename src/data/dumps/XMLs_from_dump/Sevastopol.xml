'''Sevastopol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛ|v|ə|ˈ|s|t|oʊ|p|əl|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɒ|p|əl|,_|s|ə|ˈ|v|æ|s|t|ə|p|ɒ|l|,_|-|p|əl}};&lt;ref name=&quot;MWCD_online_paywalled&quot;&gt;{{Citation | author = Merriam-Webster | authorlink = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary | publisher = Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-uk|Севастополь}}; {{lang-ru|Севастополь}}; {{lang-crh|{{lang|crh-Latn|Aqyar}}, {{lang|crh-Cyrl|Акъяр}}}})  is the largest city on the [[Crimean Peninsula]] and a major [[Black Sea]] port. Since [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexing Crimea]] in 2014, the [[Russian Federation]] has administered Sevastopol as a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]]. Nevertheless, [[Ukraine]] and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a [[city with special status]] within Ukraine. The population is made up of mostly Russians with small numbers of Ukrainians and Tatars.

Sevastopol has a population of {{Crimea-census2014|393,304|punct=,}} concentrated mostly near the [[Sevastopol Bay]] and surrounding areas. The location and navigability of the city's harbours have made Sevastopol a strategically important [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and [[Sevastopol Naval Base|naval base]] throughout history. The city has been a home to the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]], which is why it was considered as a separate city in Crimea of significant military importance and was once operated by the Soviet Union as a [[closed city]].

Although relatively small at {{convert|864|km2}}, Sevastopol's unique naval and maritime features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderate warm summers; characteristics that help make it a popular [[seaside resort]] and [[tourism|tourist]] destination, mainly for visitors [[Commonwealth of Independent States|from the former Soviet republics]]. The city is also an important centre for [[marine biology]] research. In particular, [[dolphin]]s have been studied and trained in the city by the military since the end of [[World War II]].

==Etymology==
The name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen in the same [[etymology|etymological]] trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, {{lang |grc|σεβαστός}} (''[[sebastos]]'', 'venerable') and the noun {{lang |grc|πόλις}} (''pólis'') ('city'). {{lang|grc|Σεβαστός}} is the traditional Greek equivalent ([[Sebastian (name)|Sebastian]]) of the Roman honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, [[Augustus]] and later awarded as a title to his successors.

Despite its Greek origin, the name is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after Empress (&quot;[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]&quot;) [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of the [[Russian Empire]] who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.

In the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], founded in the 5th{{citation needed| date= December 2012}} (or 4th) century BC by settlers from [[Heraclea Pontica]]. This name means &quot;peninsula&quot;, reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: ''Chersonēsos [[Taurica|Taurikē]]'' (&quot;the [[Tauri]]an Peninsula&quot;).

The name of the city is spelled as:
* In English, the current prevalent spelling of the name is ''Sevastopol''; the previously common spelling ''Sebastopol'' is still used by some publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''. In English, the current spelling also has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|v|æ|s|t|ə|p|oʊ|l}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛ|v|ə|ˈ|s|t|oʊ|p|əl}},&lt;ref name=OED-US&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Sevastopol|title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word |work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the former spelling has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|b|æ|s|t|ə|p|əl|,_|-|p|ɒ|l}}&lt;ref name=OED-b&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Sebastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|t|ə|p|oʊ|l|,_|-|p|ɒ|l}}.&lt;ref name=OED-US-b&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Sebastopol | title = definition: meaning, pronunciation and origin of the word | work = Oxford Dictionary  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 | accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century BC, a Greek colony was established in the area of the modern-day city. The Greek city of [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesus]] existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the [[Golden Horde]] several times and was finally totally abandoned. The modern day city of Sevastopol has no connection to the ancient and medieval Greek city, but the ruins are a popular tourist attraction located on the outskirts of the city.

Sevastopol was founded in June 1783 as a base for a naval squadron under the name Akhtiar&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://leksika.com.ua/19111014/ure/sevastopol | contribution = Sevastopol | title = The Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia | publisher = Leksika | place = [[Ukraine|UK]]| title-link = Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''White Cliff''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/ | contribution = Sevastopol | title = The Great Soviet Encyclopedia | publisher = Yandex | place = [[Russia|RU]]| title-link = Great Soviet Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Rear Admiral [[Thomas MacKenzie (Russian admiral)|Thomas MacKenzie]] (Foma Fomich Makenzi), a native [[Scottish people|Scot]] in Russian service; soon after [[Russian Empire|Russia]] annexed the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Five years earlier, [[Aleksandr Suvorov|Alexander Suvorov]] ordered that earthworks be erected along the harbour and Russian troops be placed there. In February 1784, [[Catherine the Great]] ordered [[Grigory Potyomkin|Grigory Potemkin]] to build a fortress there and call it Sevastopol. The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain [[Fyodor Ushakov]] who in 1788 was named commander of the [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and of the Black Sea squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sevastopol.info/history/hist_first.htm|title=Основание и развитие Севастополя (Osnovaniye i razvitiye Sevastopolya) |trans-title=Foundation and development of Sevastopol | publisher = Sevastopol.info|date=28 May 2007| accessdate=26 April 2010|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became an important [[naval base]] and later a commercial [[seaport]]. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.

One of the most notable events involving the city is the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)]] carried out by the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Piedmont|Piedmontese]], and [[Ottoman Turkey|Turkish]] troops during the [[Crimean War]], which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A [[panorama]] of the siege originally was created by [[Franz Roubaud]]. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941–42, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the [[Battle of Sevastopol]]. German forces used [[railway artillery]]—including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre ''[[Schwerer Gustav]]''—and [[Karl-Gerät|specialised mobile heavy mortars]] to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the [[Maxim Gorky Fortresses]]. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the supposedly untakable{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to &quot;''Theoderichshafen''&quot; (in reference to [[Theoderic the Great]] and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic [[Goths]] until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the [[Hero City]] title a year later.

===Sevastopol as part of Ukrainian SSR===
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, Sevastopol became a so-called &quot;[[closed city]]&quot;. This meant that any non-residents had to apply to the authorities for a temporary permit to visit the city.

On 29 October 1948, the Presidium of Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR issued a ''ukase'' (order) which confirmed the special status of the city.&lt;ref name=myths/&gt; Soviet academic publications since 1954, including the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], indicated that Sevastopol, [[Crimean Oblast]] was part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] (''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' 1976, Vol.23. pp 104).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/|title=Яндекс.Словари|work=yandex.ru|access-date=3 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817005956/http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C/|archive-date=17 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], both Sevastopol and the remainder of the Crimean peninsula were administratively [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from being territories within the Russian SFSR to being territories administered by the Ukrainian SSR.  Administratively, Sevastopol was a municipality excluded from the adjacent [[Crimean Oblast]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}{{explain|date=December 2018}} The territory of the municipality was 863.5&amp;nbsp;km² and it was further subdivided into four raions (districts). Besides the City of Sevastopol proper, it also included two towns—Balaklava (having had no status until 1957), Inkerman, urban-type settlement Kacha, and 29 villages.&lt;ref name=YavlinskyUkr&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tedMMgz3RV8C&amp;pg=PA44 |title=Contemporary Ukraine|work=google.com|isbn=9780765631503|last1=Kuzio|first1=Taras|date=15 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1955 Ukrainian parliamentary elections on 27 February, Sevastopol was split into two electoral districts, Stalinsky and Korabelny (initially requested three Stalinsky, Korabelny, and Nakhimovsky).&lt;ref name=myths/&gt; Eventually, Sevastopol received two [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|people's deputies]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] elected to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] A. Korovchenko and M. Kulakov.&lt;ref name=myths/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208203215/http://fleet.sebastopol.ua/articles/POChTI_50_LET_NAZAD._SEVASTOPOL_V_1955_GODU/printable/|title=Статьи / газета Флот України: ПОЧТИ 50 ЛЕТ НАЗАД.

In 1957, the town of [[Balaklava]] was incorporated into Sevastopol.

===After Soviet dissolution===
[[File:Музей Черноморского флота.jpg|thumb|The Black Sea Fleet Museum]]
&lt;!--Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia]] &quot;questioned&quot; legal status of Sevastopol an tasked [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] to &quot;define&quot; it.

On 11 December 1992, the [[President of Ukraine]] called the attempt of the Russian deputies to charge the Russian parliament with the task of defining the status of Sevastopol as an &quot;imperial disease&quot;. On 17 December 1992, the office of the Ukrainian presidential representative in [[Crimea]] was created, which caused a wave of protests a month later. Among the protesters who organised the unsanctioned rally were the Sevastopol branches of the National Salvation Front, the Russian Popular Assembly, and the All-Crimean Movement of the Voters for the Republic of Crimea. The protest was held in Sevastopol on 10 January at the [[Nakhimov Square]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

--&gt;On 10 July 1993, the [[Russian parliament]] passed a resolution declaring Sevastopol to be &quot;a federal Russian city&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;&gt;''Secession as an International Phenomenon: From America's Civil War to Contemporary Separatist Movements'' edited by Don Harrison Doyle (page 284)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many supporters of the [[President of Russia|president]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], had ceased taking part in the Parliament's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Serge | last = Schmemann | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/world/russian-parliament-votes-a-claim-to-ukrainian-port-of-sevastopol.html | title = Russian Parliament Votes a Claim to Russian Port of Sevastopol | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July 1993 the [[United Nations Security Council]] denounced the decision of the Russia parliament. According to [[Anatoliy Zlenko]], it was for the first time that the council had to review actions and come up with qualification of them for a legislative body.&lt;ref name=myths&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrlife.org/main/uacrim/obermif34.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208165334/http://ukrlife.org/main/uacrim/obermif34.htm|title=Українське життя в Севастополi Михайло ЛУКІНЮК ОБЕРЕЖНО: МІФИ!

On 14 April 1993, the Presidium of the Crimean Parliament called for the creation of the presidential post of the Crimean Republic. A week later, the Russian deputy, Valentin Agafonov, stated that Russia was ready to supervise the referendum on Crimean independence and include the republic as a separate entity in the CIS. On 28 July 1993, one of the leaders of the Russian Society of Crimea, Viktor Prusakov, stated that his organisation was ready for an armed mutiny and establishment of the Russian administration in Sevastopol.

In September, the commander of the joint Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet, {{ill|Eduard Baltin|ru|Балтин, Эдуард Дмитриевич|vertical-align=sup}}, accused Ukraine of converting some of his fleet and conducting an armed assault on his personnel, and threatened to take countermeasures of placing the fleet on alert. (In June 1992, the Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] and the Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] had agreed to divide the former-Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and Ukraine.  Eduard Baltin had been appointed commander of the Black Sea Fleet by Yeltsin and Kravchuk on 15 January 1993.)

In May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed the [[Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty|Peace and Friendship Treaty]], ruling out Moscow's territorial claims to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://english.people.com.cn/200512/28/eng20051228_231329.html | title = People | place = [[China|CN]] | date = 28 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate agreement established the terms of a long-term lease of land, facilities, and resources in Sevastopol and the Crimea by Russia.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The ex-Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]] and its facilities were divided between Russia's Black Sea Fleet and the [[Ukrainian Navy|Ukrainian Naval Forces]]. The two navies co-used some of the city's harbours and piers, while others were demilitarised or used by either country. Sevastopol remained the location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters with the Ukrainian Naval Forces Headquarters also in the city. A judicial row periodically continued over the naval [[hydrography|hydrographic]] infrastructure both in Sevastopol and on the Crimean coast (especially [[lighthouses]] historically maintained by the Soviet or Russian Navy and also used for civil navigation support).

As in the rest of the Crimea, Russian remained the predominant language of the city, although following the independence of Ukraine there were some attempts at [[Ukrainisation]] with very little success. The Russian society in general and even some outspoken government representatives never accepted the loss of Sevastopol and tended to regard it as temporarily separated from the homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ua.pravda.com.ua/news/2007/2/21/54793.htm|title=Лужков знайшов у серці рану і хоче почувати себе в Криму як вдома|author=|date=|work=pravda.com.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2010, Russia and Ukraine ratified the [[Russian Ukrainian Naval Base for Gas treaty]], extending the Russian Navy's lease of Crimean facilities for 25 years after 2017 (through 2042) with an option to prolong the lease in 5-year extensions. The ratification process in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] encountered stiff opposition and erupted into a brawl in the parliament chamber. Eventually, the treaty was ratified by a 52% majority vote—236 of 450.  The [[Russian Duma]] ratified the treaty by a 98% majority (without incident).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | publisher = BBC | newspaper = World | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8645847.stm | title = Parliamentary chaos as Ukraine ratifies fleet deal | date = 27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the survey by the [[U.S. Agency for Global Media|Broadcasting Board of Governors]], conducted April 21–29, 2014, showed that 83% of Crimeans felt that the results of the March 16 referendum on Crimea's status likely reflected the views of most people there. This referendum resulted in the establishment of the short-lived [[Republic of Crimea (country)|Republic of Crimea]], which consisted of both Sevastopol and Crimea.

On 18 March 2014, [[Accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation|the treaty on the incorporation of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol to Russia]] was signed between Russia and the Republic of Crimea, with the following content:&lt;ref name=&quot;Treaty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kremlin.ru/news/20605|title=Президент России|work=kremlin.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The former [[City with special status (Ukraine)|Special Status City of Sevastopol]] is incorporated as a [[Federal cities of Russia|Federal City of Russia]].
* Both territories are incorporated as part of the [[Crimean Federal District]].

The international community has overwhelmingly condemned the Russian Federation's acts in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.

The United Nations also called upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status.

The city of Sevastopol is located at the southwestern tip of the Crimean peninsula in a headland known as [[Heracles peninsula]] on a coast of the [[Black Sea]]. The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which besides the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly at the western portion of the region and around the long [[Bay of Sevastopol]]. This bay is a [[ria]], a river canyon drowned by [[Holocene]] sea-level rise, and the outlet of [[Chorna River (Crimea)|Chorna River]]. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of [[Balaklava]] (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in Soviet times served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.

The coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.

Through the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of [[Crimean mountains]] are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).

On 18 March 2014, the Kremlin announced that Sevastopol would become the third [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city]] in the [[Russian Federation]], the two others being [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]].

===City State Administration===
The executive power of Sevastopol is exercised by the [[Sevastopol City State Administration]] led by a chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sev.gov.ua/en/administr/ |title=The City State Administration |publisher=Sevastopol City State Administration |accessdate=30 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211231807/http://sev.gov.ua/en/administr/ |archivedate=11 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since April 2014 the executive power is held by the Government of Sevastopol, led by the [[Governor of Sevastopol (Russia)|City Governor]].

===Legislature===
{{main|Legislative Assembly of Sevastopol|Sevastopol City Council}} 
Before 2014, the [[Sevastopol City Council]] was the legislature of Sevastopol and the mayor of Sevastopol was appointed by the Ukrainian central government. However, during the [[2014 Crimean crisis]], the pro-Russian City Council threw its support behind Russian citizen [[Alexei Chaly]] as the &quot;people's mayor&quot; and said it would not recognise orders from [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/ukraine-sevastopol-installs-pro-russian-mayor|agency=The Guardian|title=Ukraine: Sevastopol installs pro-Russian mayor as separatism fears grow|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/sevastopol-city-council-refuses-to-recognize-kyiv-leadership-338124.html|agency=Kyiv Post|title=Sevastopol City Council refuses to recognize Kyiv leadership|date=2 March 2014|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation]], the [[Legislative Assembly of Sevastopol]] replaced the City Council and the mayor is appointed by the legislative branch on the nomination of the [[President of Russia|Russian President]],&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.sevsovet.com.ua/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2482:№6-зс-от-30042014-г-о-порядке-избрания-губернатора-города-севастополя-депутатами-законодательного-собрания-города-севастополя&amp;Itemid=226&lt;/ref&gt; and officially the mayor is called the [[Governor of Sevastopol (Russia)|Governor of Sevastopol City]].

===Administrative and municipal divisions===
{{Main|Administrative and municipal divisions of Sevastopol}}

Sevastopol is administratively divided into four districts.

Within the Russian [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal framework]], the territory of the federal city of Sevastopol is divided into nine [[okrug#Russian Federation|municipal okrugs]] and the Town of Inkerman. While individual municipal divisions are contained within the borders of the administrative districts, they are not otherwise related to the administrative districts.

===Tourism===
After [[World War II]], Sevastopol was entirely rebuilt. Many top architects and civil engineers from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other cities and thousands of workers from all parts of the USSR took part in the rebuilding process which was mostly finished by the mid-1950s. The downtown core situated on a peninsula between two narrow inlets, South Bay and Artillery Bay, features mostly Mediterranean-style, three-story residential buildings with columned balconies and Venetian-style arches, with retail and commercial spaces occupying the ground level. Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th century (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its Marine Boulevard.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Due to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes. There are hundreds of monuments and plaques in various parts of Sevastopol commemorating its military past.
