'''Salamanca''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|l|ə|ˈ|m|æ|ŋ|k|ə}} {{respell|SAL|ə|MANK|ə}}, {{IPA-es|salaˈmaŋka|lang}}) is a city in western [[Spain]] that is the capital of the [[Province of Salamanca]] in the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|community]] of [[Castile and León]]. The city lies on several hills by the [[Tormes]] River. Its Old City was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1988. With a metropolitan population of 228,881 in 2012 according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), Salamanca is the second most populated urban area in Castile and León, after [[Valladolid]] (414,000), and ahead of [[León, Spain|León]] (187,000) and [[Burgos]] (176,000).

It is one of the most important university cities in Spain and supplies 16% of Spain's market for the teaching of the [[Spanish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcastellano.org/noticia.php?id=972 |title=Noticias - Salamanca: enseñanza de español mueve 46 millones de euros |publisher=El Castellano |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espanolensalamanca.com|title=Salamanca Ciudad del Español|website=Espanolensalamanca.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salamanca attracts thousands of international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/07/02/castillayleon/1215017453.html |title=La USAL inaugura los cursos de verano con 2.000 estudiantes extranjeros |website=Elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is situated approximately {{convert|200|km|-1|abbr=off}} west of the Spanish capital [[Madrid]] and {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the Portuguese border. The [[University of Salamanca]], which was founded in 1218, is one of the oldest universities in Spain and the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|third]] oldest western university, but the first to be given its status by the [[Pope Alexander IV]] who gave universal validity to its degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.usal.es/~alfonix/GIR/historia/cyl/medieval3.htm|date=December 2017 |title=La cristiandad y el reino. Universitas|website=www.usal.es|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its 30,000 students, the university is, together with tourism, a primary source of income in Salamanca. It is on the [[Via de la Plata]] path of the [[Camino de Santiago]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Salamanca}}
The city was founded in the pre-[[Ancient Rome]] period by the [[Vaccaei]], a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic]] tribe, or the [[Vettones]], a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic]] or pre-Celtic indo-European tribe, as one of a pair of forts to defend their territory near the [[Duero]] river. In 220 BC [[Hannibal]] laid siege to the city and captured it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espanolensalamanca.com/ciudadsalamanca.asp?lang=en&amp;sec=7|title=History of Salamanca - Salamanca The City  to  learn Spanish|website=Espanolensalamanca.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the fall of the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] to the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], the city of Helmantica, as it was known, began to take more importance as a commercial hub in the Roman [[Hispania]] due to its favorable location. Salamanca lay on a [[Roman road]], known as the [[Vía de la Plata]], which connected it with [[Emerita Augusta]] (present day [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]]) to the south and [[Asturica Augusta]] (present-day [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]]) to the north. Its [[Roman bridge]] dates from the 1st century, and was a part of this road.

With the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Alans]] established in Lusitania, and Salamanca was part of this region. Later the city was conquered by the [[Visigoth]]s and included in their territory. The city was already an episcopal [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salamanca|see]], and signatures of bishops of [[Bishopric of Salamanca|Salamanca]] are found in the [[Councils of Toledo]].

Salamanca surrendered to the [[Moors]], led by [[Musa bin Nusair]], in the year 712 AD. For years, this area between the south of [[Duero River]] and the north of [[Tormes River]], became the main battlefield between the Christian kingdoms and the Muslim [[Al-Andalus]] rulers. The constant fighting of the [[Kingdom of León]] first, and the [[Kingdom of Castile and León]] later against the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Caliphate]] depopulated Salamanca and reduced it to an unimportant settlement. After the [[battle of Simancas]] (939) the Christians resettled this area. After the capture of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] in 1085, the definitive resettlement of the city took place. [[Raymond of Burgundy]], instructed by his father-in-law [[Alfonso VI of León]], led a group of settlers of various origins in 1102.

One of the most important moments in Salamanca's history was the year 1218, when [[Alfonso IX of León]] granted a royal charter to the [[University of Salamanca]], although formal teaching had existed at least since 1130. Soon it became one of the most significant and prestigious academic centres in Europe.

During the 16th century, the city reached its height of splendour (around 6,500 students and a total population of 24,000). During that period, the [[University of Salamanca]] hosted the most important intellectuals of the time; these groups of mostly-[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] scholars were designated the [[School of Salamanca]]. The juridical doctrine of the School of Salamanca represented the end of medieval concepts of law, and founded the fundamental body of the ulterior European law and morality concepts, including rights as a corporeal being (right to life), economic rights (right to own property) and spiritual rights (rights to freedom of thought and rights related to intrinsic human dignity).

In 1551, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]  ordered an inquiry to find out if the science of Andreas [[Vesalius]], physician and anatomist, was in line with Catholic doctrine. Vesalius came to Salamanca that same year to appear before the board and was acquitted.

Salamanca suffered the general downturns of the Kingdom of Castile during the 17th century, but in the 18th century it experienced a rebirth. In this period, the new baroque [[New Cathedral of Salamanca|Cathedral]] and main square (Plaza Mayor) were finished.

In the [[Peninsular War]] of the Napoleonic campaigns, the [[Battle of Salamanca]], in which an [[Anglo-Portuguese Army]] led by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] decisively defeated the French army of [[Auguste de Marmont|Marmont]], was fought on 22 July 1812. The western quarter of Salamanca was seriously damaged by cannon fire. The battle which raged that day is famous as a defining moment in military history and many thousands of men were killed in the space of only a few short hours.
[[File:Slm1858.jpg|thumb|right|Salamanca City map in 1858.]]

During the devastating Spanish Civil War (1936–39) the city quickly went over to the Nationalist side and was used as the ''de facto'' capital. Franco was named ''Generalissimo'' on 21 September 1937 while at the city, and in the same year was formed, by a decree signed in the city, the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista|official fascist party that ruled Spain until the end of the Francoist regime]], officially suppressing any other political party. The Nationalists soon moved most of the administrative departments to [[Burgos]], which being more central was better suited for this purpose. However, some administrative departments, Franco's headquarters (located at the Palacio Episcopal, next to the Old Cathedral) and the military commands stayed in Salamanca, along with the German and Italian fascist delegations, making it the ''de facto'' Nationalist capital and centre of power during the entire civil war.&lt;ref name=ht01&gt;Hugh Thomas, pág. 550&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ht02&gt;Hugh Thomas, pág. 650&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of fervently Catholic and largely rural [[León (historical region)|Leon]] and [[Old Castile]] regions, Salamanca was a staunch supporter of the Nationalist side and [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime for its long duration.

In 1988, the old city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1998, it was declared a European Capital of Culture for year 2002 (shared with Bruges). During 14 and 15 October 2005, it hosted the XV Ibero-American Summits of Heads of State and Governments.

Since 1996, Salamanca has been the designated site of the [[General Archive of the Spanish Civil War|archives of the Spanish Civil War]] (''Archivo General de la Guerra Civil Española''). The original documents were assembled by the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] regime, selectively obtained from the administrative departments of various institutions and organizations during the Spanish Civil War as a repressive instrument used against opposition groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-lVcN3_l3sC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=http://www.mcu.es/archivos/jsp/plantillaAncho.jsp?id=64&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N8g0a4ZES8&amp;sig=fkEGi516_WmjF3G6OA7N_EbpnUQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o23jVLSbKMj-UpL-gfgI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=http://www.mcu.es/archivos/jsp/plantillaAncho.jsp?id=64&amp;f=false|title=Patrimoni digital: un nou mitjà al servei de les institucions culturals|first1=César Carreras|last1=Monfort|first2=Glòria Munilla|last2=Cabrillana|date=5 August 2017|publisher=Editorial UOC|accessdate=5 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The socialist government moved the Catalan part of the archive to Barcelona in 2006 despite opposition from the local authorities and popular protests.

==University==
[[File:Fachada de la Universidad de Salamanca.jpg|thumb|left|Plateresque façade of the [[University of Salamanca]].]]

The [[University of Salamanca]] was founded in 1134 and in 1218 it was given the royal charter of foundation (&quot;Estudio General&quot;) by [[Alfonso IX of León]]. It was the first university to receive the title of &quot;University&quot; in 1254.  Under the patronage of the learned [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], its wealth and reputation greatly increased (1252–1282), and its schools of [[canon law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] attracted students even from the Universities of Paris and Bologna.{{When|date=November 2010}} In the 16th century,  the city's fortunes depended on those of the University. About the time [[Christopher Columbus]] was lecturing there on his discoveries, [[Hernán Cortés]] took classes at Salamanca, but returned home in 1501 at age 17, without completing his course of study. (About ten years later the ''[[conquistador]]'' [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] was born in Salamanca.)

==Climate==
With an altitude of over 800 meters, Salamanca has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csb'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]], with some [[cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') climatic influences, resulting in large [[diurnal temperature variation]]s, a slightly hotter summer and colder winter, and nearly-semi-arid levels of precipitation. Nearly all of the year's precipitation falls outside of the summer, with upticks at the end of the spring and during the winter; snow is not common, with only a few days per year on average seeing snow.

===Festivals===

=== Holy Week ===
{{Main|Holy Week in Salamanca}}
The [[Holy Week in Salamanca]] (Semana Santa) is the most well-known of Salamanca's festivals. Salamanca is renowned for the solemn and sober processions celebrated during Holy Week. 16 confraternities, 10.000 brothers or &quot;cofrades&quot;, 50 floats or &quot;[[Paso (float)|paso]]s&quot; celebrate the [[Passion of Christ]] with 20 processions and thousands of followers, tourist and visitors.

Some of the celebrations have been performed for centuries. The confraternities carry artistic pasos created by important Spanish artists such as [[Luis Salvador Carmona]], [[Alejandro Carnicero]] or [[Mariano Benlliure]]. in 2003 the Semana Santa of Salamanca obtained the official declaration of International Touristic Interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamanca.es/en/easter Easter | Salamanca].

==== Other ====
Salamanca is also famous throughout Spain and the rest of Europe for its celebrations of &quot;[[Nochevieja]] Universitaria,&quot; loosely translated as &quot;University New Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkriberawine.com/2012/12/nochevieja-universitaria/|title=University New Year|website=Drinkriberawine.com|access-date=5 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118035518/http://www.drinkriberawine.com/2012/12/nochevieja-universitaria/|archive-date=18 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2016}} It is usually held on the Thursday of the last week of school in December and two weeks before the real New Year's Eve. On this day, students congregate in the [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca]] to watch free performances and take part in the countdown to midnight.

===Sports===
From 1923 onward, &quot;Los Charros,” formally the [[Union Deportiva Salamanca]], were the Salamanca football team. In 2013, the club went bankrupt and its activities were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lagacetadesalamanca.es/uds/2013/06/29/rfef-desciende-uds-deudas-futbolistas/97081.html La RFEF desciende a la UDS por las deudas con los futbolistas - UDS -Noticias de La Gaceta de Salamanca]. Lagacetadesalamanca.es (2013-06-29). Retrieved on 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; After its dissolution, some managers of the entity decided to refound the farm team to continue competing, maintaining the legacy of the historic club. Thus they created the [[Club Deportivo Club de Fútbol Salmantino|Club de Fútbol Salmantino]].

The first [[high jump]] over 8 feet (2.44 m) was made in Salamanca, by [[Javier Sotomayor]] in 1993. His jump, of 2.45 m (8 feet 0.46 inch), is still the [[High jump#Men .28absolute.29|world record]] in the event.

===Teams based in Salamanca===
*''[[Salamanca CF]]'', [[football (soccer)|footba]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ll team 
*''[[Unionistas de Salamanca CF]]'', [[football (soccer)|football]] team.
*''[[CB Avenida]]'', [[basketball]] team.

===Cinema===
[[File:Hornazo (Salamaca)-Cerca01.JPG|thumb|Typical [[hornazo]].]]
With its old streets being ideal for historical film settings Salamanca has been used several times in cinematic productions, including ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'' by Ridley Scott and ''[[Goya's Ghosts]]'' by Miloš Forman. Salamanca was also the setting for the 2008 political thriller ''[[Vantage Point (film)|Vantage Point]]'', although the movie was almost exclusively filmed in Mexico.

===Gastronomy===
Salamanca has a very interesting and distinctive gastronomy. Among many dishes, '''Chanfaina''' (steamed rice with pork) is very popular.  Another classic dish of the Salamancan, known as '''Charreria''' (&quot;peasant lands&quot;), is a ''cocido'', a slow-cooked casserole including [[chickpea]]s. However, '''[[Hornazo]]''', a meat pie, is the most popular dish of all.
