==History==
Rhenock was covered with dense forest in and around the 13th century. The [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] were the early settlers about five or six hundred years ago. Middle of 16th century the [[Bhutia]]s, migrated from [[Tibet]] settled in the villages presently known as Kyongsa, Aritar, Tarpin, Reshi and Chalisey. The people who settled were Gorkha ethnic groups such as Newars, Bahuns (Adhikari, Poudyal, Gautam, Dahal, Bhandari, Pokhrel and Achaarja), Chhetri (Subedi, Khatiwada &amp; Bista), Gurung, Rai and Limboo. Some people from Northern parts of India also migrated here at around 1940-1960 for business.

==People==
'''Rhenock''' is inhabited by people of different ethnic groups such as [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]], [[Bhutia]]s, [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepali]]s ([[Gurkha|Gorkha]]s), [[Bihari people|Biharis]] and [[Marwaris]]. [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] tribes who were early settlers have their own unique culture. Originally followers of [[Shamanism]], they later became followers of [[Buddhism]]. Some of them are followers of [[Christianity]]. [[Bhutia]]s are another group of tribes who are followers of [[Buddhism]] and who have their own identity and culture. The majority of the people are [[India]]n Nepalis also known as Gorkha. Most of them are [[Hindu]]s by religion. Some of the Nepalis [[Gurung]] after 1990 became [[Buddhist]]; before that they were followers of Hinduism. Some others are followers of [[Christianity]]. In spite of the above, everyone respects others' beliefs and faiths and celebrates others' festivals which makes a peaceful and prosperous [[society]].

==Educational institutions==
Rhenock has about 130 years of history of education. Rhenock School is among the oldest schools of Sikkim. It was established by a Christian missionary in 1880 at Rhenock (Khamdong).&lt;ref&gt;http://dietgangtok.nic.in/html/aboutus.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was taken over by the government of Sikkim and shifted to Kingstone.
