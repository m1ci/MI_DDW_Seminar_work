'''Qadirabad''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|قادرآباد}}}}) is a city located near [[Chenab River]] in tehsil [[Phalia]] in [[Mandi Bahauddin District]] in province [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbdin.net/qadirabad/ Website of District Mandi Bahauddin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820142826/http://www.mbdin.net/qadirabad/ |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]], In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of [[Punjab region]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]].

The name 'Qadirabad' comes from the name of Mirza Qadir Khan, whose grave and that of his brother's grave are in Qadirabad. A wall was built enclosing the city between 1556-1605 with three gateways.

After the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh Empire]] invaded and occupied [[Mandi Bahauddin District]]. The [[Muslim]]s faced restrictions during the Sikh rule.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} During the period of [[British Raj|British rule]], Bahawalnagar increased in population and importance.

The predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s [[Human migration|migrated]] to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]]s refugees from [[India]] settled down in the [[Mandi Bahauddin District]].

==Demographics==
The population of Qadirabad was calculated to be 102,555 in 2014 (10,186 in 1998).&lt;ref name=WG&gt;{{cite web| title =Qadirabad| work =World Gazetteer| url =http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-76666&amp;srt=npan&amp;col=aohdq| accessdate =2007-10-28| archiveurl =https://archive.today/20130209134349/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gpro&amp;lng=en&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-76666&amp;srt=npan&amp;col=aohdq| archivedate =2013-02-09| url-status =dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The [[Chenab River]] is less than five kilometres to the south of Qadirabad. The nearest cities are [[Phalia]], about 20 kilometres away, [[Mandi Bahauddin]], about 40 kilometres away, and [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], about 70 kilometres away. Sialkot International Airport is about 115&amp;nbsp;km from Qadirabad. Sargodha from Qadirabad through Bhalwal is ~ 98 kilometres and through Sial More is about 105&amp;nbsp;km. Faisalabad through motorway M-3 is ~ 165&amp;nbsp;km . Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore from Qadirabad is ~210&amp;nbsp;km through motorway and is ~180&amp;nbsp;km through Gujranwala. Old Ravi bridge Lahore from Qadirabad is ~ 150&amp;nbsp;km through Gujranwala and is 185&amp;nbsp;km through Motorway. Benazir Bhutto International Airport Islamabad/Rawalpindi is ~ 255&amp;nbsp;km through Motorway, ~ 200&amp;nbsp;km through Mandi Bahauddin (at night not safe to travel this road) and ~ 230&amp;nbsp;km through Gujrat (relatively safe to travel at night). Hafizabad is about 65&amp;nbsp;km through Qadirabad headworks. Aerial distance of Hafizabad from Qadirabad through Vanike Tarar is about 30&amp;nbsp;km but there is no bridge on the river Chenab in between. If the Chinab river is dry then Hafizabad is about 6 to 7 hours walking distance from Qadirabad. That is reason to give big benefit to the people of Tehsil Phalia/Qadirabad and the people of District Hafizabad, a bridge in between Qadirabad and Vanike Tarar on the River Chenab is recommended to connect the people of two districts more closer. It will also make easier to the people of Tehsil Phalia to travel to Lahore through Motorway.

==Transport==
The nearest railway station is located at [[Mandi Bahauddin]]. The nearest international airports are located at [[Lahore]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Sialkot]] and [[Islamabad]], which are each about three to four hours drive away. The main roads lead from Qadirabad to [[Malakwal]]; Mandi Bahauddin via Phalia; Mandi Bahauddin via Kathalan Sheikhan; [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]] via Phalia; and Gujrat via Jokalian.
