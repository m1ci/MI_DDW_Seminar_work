      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cricket-spitting''' is a sport wherein contestants place a dead [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] in their mouth, and then spit it as far as they can. The contestant who can spit the cricket the farthest is declared the winner.

Cricket-spitting was developed in 1996 by [[entomology|entomologist]] Tom Turpin at [[Purdue University]] in West Lafayette, Indiana, as a competition for their annual Bug Bowl event, which brings over 30,000 people per year to their campus for a series of insect-related events and competitions. Since its creation, other universities have begun their own competitions, such as [[Pennsylvania State University]] who have hosted their own 'spit-off' since 1998. A Scottish spin off of Cricket-Spitting is Wasp Waving, where contestants throw frozen wasps at a target while blind folded.

==World record==

The Guinness World Record for cricket-spitting is {{convert|32|ft|.5|in|m}} and is held by Dan Capps, from Madison, Wisconsin, and was set in June 1998 in front of a live television audience.  
Robert Tony Ferrell, from Hoopeston, Illinois, held the title/record in the 1997 Bug Bowl Games until upset by Dan Capps. Unofficial records of over 38 feet have been noted at competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
