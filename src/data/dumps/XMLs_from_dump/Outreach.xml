'''Outreach''' is the activity of providing services to any population that might not otherwise have access to those services.&lt;ref name=&quot;HardyKingston2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Centre2009&quot;/&gt; A key component of outreach is that the group providing it is not stationary, but mobile; in other words, it involves meeting someone in need of an outreach service at the location where they are.&lt;ref name=&quot;HardyKingston2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Centre2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dewson&quot;/&gt; In addition to delivering services, outreach has an educational role, raising the awareness of existing services.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt; It includes identification of under-served populations and service referral.

Outreach is often meant to fill in the gap in the services provided by mainstream (often governmental) services, and is often carried out by [[non-profit]], [[nongovernmental organization]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HardyKingston2010&quot;/&gt; This is a major element differentiating outreach from [[public relations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EliassonRiemer1999&quot;/&gt; Compared with staff providing traditional services, outreach staff may be less qualified but more highly motivated.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Three different types of outreach have been identified: domiciliary (undertaken at individual homes), detached (undertaken in public environments and targeting individuals), and peripatetic (undertaken at public or private environments and targeting organizations rather than individuals).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhodes1996&quot;/&gt; Satellite outreach is where services are provided at a dedicated site.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Outreach tools include leaflets, newsletters, advertising stalls and displays, and dedicated events. Outreach commonly takes place physically at local community institutions such as libraries, community centres and markets.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt; Compared with traditional service providers, outreach services are provided closer to where people live, are voluntary, and have fewer, if any, enforceable obligations.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Outreach can target various populations, from [[sex workers]]&lt;ref name=&quot;HardyKingston2010&quot;/&gt; and [[drug]] users&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhodes1996&quot;/&gt; to museum goers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sachatello-Sawyer2002&quot;/&gt;
