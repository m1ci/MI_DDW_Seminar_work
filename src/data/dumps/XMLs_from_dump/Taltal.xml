According to the 2012 census, the commune has a population of 11,132 and has an area of {{convert|20405.1|sqkm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;INE&quot;/&gt;
The commune is home to [[Paranal Observatory]] and includes the northern portion of [[Pan de Azúcar National Park]].

==Etymology ==
The etymological origin of the name is the indigenous word ''Thalthal'', which means “night bird.”&lt;ref&gt;[[:m:s:es:Página:Diccionario Geográfico de la República de Chile (1899).djvu/798|Diccionario Geográfico de la República de Chile (1899) página 790]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of Taltal begins with the opening of the copper mine &quot;El Cobre&quot; by José Antonio Moreno in 1850 about 20 kilometers north of Taltal.  This brought miners and prospectors to the area. In 1855 Moreno expanded his operations to include Taltal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist-1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Taltal: Un puerto nacido del empuje |language=es |publisher=Municipalidad de Taltal |url=http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725152531/http://www.taltal.cl/contenido/44/historia |archivedate=25 July 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of copper in 1858 on nearby Mount Cachiyuyal increased pressure on the port, which had to utilize customs officials from [[Copiapo]]. So Moreno requested official recognition of the port which was granted by decree&lt;ref&gt;Decreto Supremo Nº 91 signed by Chilean President [[Manuel Montt Torres]].&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 July 1858.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist-1&quot; /&gt;

However, the real boom began in 1876 with the opening of nitrate mines, in particular [[potassium nitrate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist-1&quot; /&gt; In 1879, the first nitrates were shipped from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Caleta Oliva, Un Hito Histórico |language=es |date=23 June 2008 |publisher=Municipalidad de Taltal |url=http://www.taltal.cl/noticias/582/caleta-oliva-un-hito-historico |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811002743/http://www.taltal.cl/noticias/582/caleta-oliva-un-hito-historico |archivedate=11 August 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882 a railway was completed from Cachinal de la Sierra and other nitrate mining sites. It was built by the &quot;Taltal Railway Company&quot;, a British company, sold to private investors in 1954, and dismantled in 1970 due to the end of nitrate mining. At the peak of production in the 1930s, Taltal had a population of over 30,000 and was the third largest nitrate port in Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist-1&quot; /&gt;
