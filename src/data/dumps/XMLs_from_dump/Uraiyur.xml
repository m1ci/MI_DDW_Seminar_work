{{Chola history}}
'''Uraiyur''' is an area of [[Tiruchirapalli]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It was the capital of the [[early Cholas]], who were one of the three main kingdoms of the [[ancient Tamil country]].  Sometimes spelt as ''Urayur'', this location is also known as ''Thirukkozhi'', ''Nikalaapuri'', ''Uranthai'', and ''Kozhiyur'' or ''Koliyur''. It has a history dating back to before 200 BCE There is definite mention of the Cholas, and their capital in Ashokan inscriptions in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] pushing back the antiquity of the Cholas as well as Uraiyur to 272–232 BCE, which was the period of [[Ashoka]] (ca. 304–232 BCE) who was ruler of the [[Maurya Dynasty]] of [[Pataliputra]] (modern [[Patna]]).   Inscriptions and rock edicts of Ashoka and the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] describe Urayur as &quot;the citadel and centre of the Cholas&quot;. Uraiyur was ruled by [[Karikala|Karikala Cholan]].

==History==

Uraiyur is also mentioned as the capital of the ancient great [[Karikala Chola|Chola King Karikalan]] before the 1st century CE until the dynasty was revived by [[Vijayalaya Chola]] c. 850 CE. The [[Cholas]] were one of the four great Tamil dynasties; ([[Pallavas]], [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] and [[Pandyas]] are the other three) who ruled over the [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamil country]] in [[South India]], the Konkan coast, Deccan Plateau and during the peak reached beyond the Narmada up to the Ganges {{en dash}} Damodar delta from early antiquity.

The word ''Urayur'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literally means &quot;the residence&quot;.  Urayur was an ancient Chola city with a fortress and city wall on the southern banks of the river [[Kaveri]]. The Imperial Cholas of the 9th century CE and later made [[Tanjavur]] their capital, and Urayur slowly lost its place in the Chola administration.
