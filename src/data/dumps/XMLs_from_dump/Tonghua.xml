'''Tonghua''' ({{zh|c=通化 |p=Tōnghuà}}) is an industrial city in the south of [[Jilin]] province, People's Republic of China. It borders [[North Korea]]'s [[Chagang Province]] to the south and southeast, [[Baishan]] to the east, [[Jilin City]] to the north, [[Liaoyuan]] to the northwest, and [[Liaoning]] province to the west and southwest. Administratively, it is a [[prefecture-level city]] with a total population of 2,325,242 living in an area of {{convert|15195|km2}}. Urban population is 506,877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.my12340.cn/article.aspx?ID=1605 |script-title=zh:2010年通化市第六次全国人口普查主要数据公报 |trans-title=Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China: Report on important statistics |website=my12340.cn}}{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001120/http://www.my12340.cn/article.aspx?ID=1605 |date=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known as one of the five medicine production centres in China.&lt;ref name = &quot;City Intro&quot;/&gt;

==History==
Human settlement in the Tonghua area dates from about 6000 years ago. In the [[Western Han Dynasty]], Tonghua belonged to the Liaodong Fourth Commandery ({{lang|zh-hant|遼東四郡}}).

Tonghua was the birthplace of [[Goguryeo]] culture and [[Shamanism|shaman]] culture. Goguryeo culture originated form Jian in 425 A.D. And the Goguryeo noble tombs were the only independent declarations in the Northeast of Tonghua. &lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/jilin/2014-10/29/content_18824404.htm|title=Tonghua - Jilin, China|last=dell|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Japanese occupation of Manchuria after 1932, a railway was constructed linking Tonghua with the main Manchurian rail network and with northern Korea. 

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[Yang Jingyu]] led the First Army of the [[Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army]] to battle the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and was killed in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonghua.gov.cn/zjth/|script-title=zh:通化市政府|website=www.tonghua.gov.cn|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

In August 1945 Tonghua briefly served as the temporary capital of [[Manchukuo]], where Puyi claimed to abdicate at the behest of the [[Kwantung Army]]. In 1985, Tonghua became a prefecture-level city under the approval of the State Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |script-title=zh:通化市志 |author=Office of the Tonghua Almanac Compilation Committee |year=1996 |publisher=中国城市出版社 |isbn=7-5074-0818-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a recent record of extreme violence including the [[:ja:小山克事件|Shosankoku incident]] in 1945, the [[Tonghua Incident]] in 1946 and the [[Tonghua Iron and Steel Group riot]] in 2009.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Tonghua has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''), with long, very cold, windy, but dry winters and hot, humid summers; spring and autumn are brief. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−14.2|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|22.3|°C|1}} in July; the annual mean is {{convert|5.60|°C|1}}. During the warmer months, rainfall is enhanced by the mountainous topography, allowing for a generous annual precipitation total of {{convert|870|mm|1}}. However, the monsoon still means that more than 60% of the annual precipitation falls from June to August alone.

==Economy==

Traditionally, Tonghua occupied a railhub position in a region of China noted for trade in only three agricultural commodities. These were [[ginseng]], [[marten]] furs and [[Deer#Antlers|deer antler]] products. In the 1980s Tonghua had some success with a wine distillery producing sweet, sticky red wines that proved popular with local consumers. From 1987 onwards a bienniel wine festival was inaugurated, but this and the industry it promoted ultimately failed commercially owing to competition with joint-venture wine companies such as Dragon, who were able to produce a product that was marketable overseas. Following this failure, Tonghua industry was thrown back on its traditional agricultural products - and a few small but viable factories, including one specialising in [[fake fur|artificial furs]].

A fledgling tourist trade sought to highlight Tonghua attractions such as some impressive [[skiing|ski]] slopes, the tomb of the local hero General Yang (a resister to the Japanese occupation of Manchukuo in the 1930s) and the beautiful [[Changbai Mountains|Changbai Shan Nature Reserve]] for which Tonghua serves as a connecting railway station from the major population centres to the north and west.

Tonghua's population hovers around 300,000, but census information is difficult to assess as it includes demographic information from other towns nearby (for example, [[Erdaojiang]] - a suburb of Tonghua, and even [[Hunjiang City|Hunjiang]], a city to the east). The inclusion of these suburbs and surrounding towns greatly swells Tonghua's official population beyond the 300,000-mark.



===Steel===
[[File:巡道工出品 photo by xundaogong 通化钢铁厂 - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Tonghua Steel Factory]]
Erdaojiang District has a number of steelworks, and tens of thousands of steelworkers are employed locally.  In July 2009, workers at [[Tonghua Iron and Steel Group]] rioted ''(See [[Tonghua Iron and Steel Group riot|main article]])'' at news of a takeover deal by privately owned [[Jianlong Steel]], and the general manager of the firm was beaten to death.  The unrest reportedly involved 30,000 workers, with up to 100 injured in clashes with police.  The takeover was promptly scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8169169.stm One killed in China steel riot], BBC News, 26 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=c54a6f6217ab2210VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=China&amp;s=News Takeover scrapped after workers kill steel plant manager] SCMP, 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
The city of Tonghua has also become a hub for a range of Chinese pharmaceutical firms, including domestic insulin producer Tonghua Dongbao Pharmaceuticals Ltd. These companies are generally spread among the various &quot;Industrial parks&quot; found throughout the city, with 46 projects located in these parks in 2012 alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2013-04/25/content_16447322.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Investment in Tonghua's pharmaceutical industry is on the increase, with 27 of these projects worth over 100 million Yuan. Other pharmaceutical producers in the area include Jingma, Zhenghe and Wantong Pharmaceuticals.

==Transportation==

===Railway===
Railways from Shenyang to [[Jilin City|Jilin]] and Meihekou to Ji'an meets in Tonghua. Trains from Tonghua Railway Station connect the city with Beijing, Qingdao, Shenyang, Dalian and several other major cities in China.

===Highway===
Tonghua is served by [[G11 Hegang-Dalian Expressway]].

== Tourism ==

=== Yang Jingyu Martyrs Cemetery ===
The Yang Jingyu Martyrs Cemetery is located on the hills adjoining the Tongjiang River in Tonghua and was built to commemorate [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] war hero, [[Yang Jingyu]]. It was built in July 1954 and completed in September 1957. The cemetery covers an area of {{convert|20000|m2|abbr=on}}. There are five buildings in the park, which are classical glazed tile buildings. The front is the mourning hall and the tomb. The four partial temples are the performance exhibition hall of General Yang Jingyu. The bronze statue of General Yang Jingyu erects on the central of the cemetery. The front of the granite base is engraved with [[Peng Zhen]]’s handwriting: The National Hero Yang Jingyu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinamartyrs.gov.cn/LingYuanZhanShi/C031/zdjs.html |script-title=zh:杨靖宇烈士陵园|website=www.chinamartyrs.gov.cn|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baijifeng National Forest Park ===
It is located in the southeast of Tonghua, 25 kilometers away from the urban area. The altitude of the Baiji Yaoshan in the park is {{convert|1318|m|abbr=on}}, which is the highest peak of Tonghua.

The Forest Park is dominated by natural landscapes. The total area of the park is about {{convert|1041|ha}} and the forest coverage rate is 98.7%. The main species are [[Korean pine]], [[spruce]], [[alfalfa]], [[birch]], and rare species such as yew, [[hedgehog]]{{clarify|date=December 2018|reason=A very rare plant indeed}}, [[Common hawthorn|hawthorn]], and [[magnolia]]. Under the canopy, there are mainly wild ginseng, [[ginseng]], [[asarum]] and other medicinal materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jl.gov.cn/szfzt/stjlmlzg/zrbh/slgy/gjslgy/201507/t20150713_3768628.html|script-title=zh:生态吉林 美丽中国|publisher=Jilin Provincial People's Government|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
