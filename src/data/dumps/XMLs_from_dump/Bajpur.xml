'''Bazpur''' is a city and a [[municipality]] in [[Udham Singh Nagar district]]  in the state of [[Uttarakhand]], [[India]].

Bazpur is well connected with the industrial city of [[Rudrapur, Uttarakhand|Rudrapur]] and the historical city of [[Kashipur, Uttarakhand|Kashipur]]. It is an affluent town, mainly due to large agricultural estates. It was initially, like most of the area which forms present day Udham Singh Nagar District, a part of the [[Terai]], and was gradually transformed into arable land by migrants from [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]. Most of the early settlers were those rendered homeless by the [[Partition of India]] in 1947.

It was in Bajpur that India's first co-operative sugar mill went into production on 16 February 1959.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}
