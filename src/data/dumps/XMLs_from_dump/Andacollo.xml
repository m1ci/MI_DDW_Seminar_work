'''Andacollo''' ({{IPA-es|an.da.ˈko.ʝo}}) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in the [[Elqui Province]], [[Coquimbo Region]], [[Chile]].

==History==
{{Main|Our Lady of Andacollo}}
Andacollo is a copper and gold mining city located in the mountains of the Small North (El Norte Chico) in Chile. It was founded in 1891. 

Several legends are told about the name of the city. Some say that it comes from the [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''Anta-Goya'' which means cobre-reina (copper queen). Others say that the name means &quot;Hurry up, Collo&quot; (''Anda, Co''llo). According to these legends, ''La Virgen del Rosario'', also known as ''la Virgen Morena'', or [[Black Madonna]], appeared to an indigenous miner called &quot;Collo&quot; in the form of a small wooden statuette hidden in rocks. The statue told the newly converted Collo to build up a church at the place where Andacollo is located today. As many miracles are attributed to the Dark Lady (like stopping the [[smallpox]] epidemic of 1871) the city celebrates the Virgin every year on December 24 to 26.

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 [[census]] of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], Andacollo had 10,288 inhabitants (5,148 men and 5,140 women). Of these, 9,444 (91.8%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 844 (8.2%) in [[rural area]]s. The population fell by 16% (1,958 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.&lt;ref name= &quot;INE&quot;/&gt;

==Administration==
As a commune, Andacollo is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an [[alcalde]] who is directly elected every four years.

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Andacollo is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Mr. Mario Bertolino ([[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]]) and Marcelo Díaz ([[Socialist Party of Chile|PS]]) as part of the 7th electoral district, (together with [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], [[La Higuera, Chile|La Higuera]], [[Vicuña, Chile|Vicuña]] and [[Paiguano]]). The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by Evelyn Matthei Fornet ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]) and Jorge Pizarro Soto ([[Christian Democratic Party|PDC]]) as part of the 4th senatorial constituency (Coquimbo Region).
