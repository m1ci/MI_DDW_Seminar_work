'''Hyena-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of [[hyenas]].

==History==
The [[striped hyena]] has historically been the most frequently used species. Hyenas can be challenging opponents for dogs, as their jaws are exceedingly powerful. A single bite from a hyena lasting a few seconds without holding on is sufficient to kill a large dog.&lt;ref&gt;''Sketches of Indian Field Sports: With Observations on the Animals; Also an Account of Some of the Customs of the Inhabitants; with a Description of the Art of Catching Serpents, as Practised by the Conjoors and Their Method of Curing Themselves when Bitten: with Remarks on Hydrophobia and Rabid Animals'' by [[Daniel Johnson (surgeon)|Daniel Johnson]], published by R. Jennings, 1827&lt;/ref&gt; Hyenas apparently fight dogs by trying to cripple them by biting at their legs.&lt;ref&gt;''Elements of geology: including fossil botany and palaeontology.

The [[Qalandar (clan)|Qalandar]] and the Thori in southern [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Kandahar]] and [[Quetta]], catch striped hyenas in order to pit them against specially trained dogs. The hyenas are restrained with ropes in order to pull them away from the dogs if necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/afs/pdf/a1246.pdf | title = The Magicality of the Hyena: Beliefs and Practices in West and South Asia | publisher = Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 57, 1998: 331–344 | accessdate = 23 June 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625072539/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/afs/pdf/a1246.pdf | archivedate = 2008-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]], captured hyenas sometimes had [[bridle]]s placed in their mouths in order to prevent them from injuring the dogs. This was done in order to train the dogs into not fearing the animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magic&quot; /&gt;
It is known that a [[Dogue de Bordeaux]] bitch named Megre was pitted against hyenas in 1895, though the exact species was not identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dogue&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bulldoginformation.com/evolution-of-the-bulldog.html | title = The Dogue de Bordeaux | publisher = The Bulldog Information Library | accessdate = 3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
