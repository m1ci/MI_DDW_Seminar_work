Continuous habitation is not an issue---&gt; to which the ancient city lends its name.

Antioch was founded near the end of the fourth century BC by [[Seleucus I Nicator]], one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s generals. The city's geographical, military, and economic location benefited its occupants, particularly such features as the [[spice trade]], the [[Silk Road]], and the [[Royal Road]]. It eventually rivaled [[Alexandria]] as the chief city of the Near East. The city was the capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]] until 63 B.C. when the Romans took control, making it the seat of the governor of the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]]. From the early 4th century, the city was the seat of the Count of the Orient, head of the regional administration of sixteen provinces.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} It was also the main center of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] at the end of the [[Second Temple period]]. Antioch was one of the most important cities in the [[eastern Mediterranean]] of Rome's dominions. It covered almost {{convert|1100|acre|sqkm}} within the walls of which one quarter was mountain, leaving {{convert|750|acre|sqkm}} about one-fifth the area of Rome within the Aurelian Walls.

Antioch was called &quot;the cradle of [[History of Christianity|Christianity]]&quot; as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both [[Hellenistic Judaism]] and [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The mixture of Roman, Greek, and Jewish elements admirably adapted Antioch for the great part it played in the early history of Christianity. The city was the cradle of the church.&quot; — &quot;Antioch,&quot; ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]'', Vol. I, p. 186 (p. 125 of 612 in [https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabib01cheyuoft online .pdf file]. '''Warning:''' Takes several minutes to download).&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian New Testament asserts that the name &quot;Christian&quot; first emerged in Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm|title=Acts of the Apostles 11:26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the four cities of the [[Syrian tetrapolis]], and its residents were known as ''Antiochenes''. The city was a [[metropolis]] of a quarter million people during [[Augustus|Augustan]] times,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} but it declined to relative insignificance during the [[Middle Ages]] because of warfare, repeated earthquakes, and a change in [[trade route]]s, which no longer passed through Antioch from the far east following the [[Mongol invasions and conquests]].

==Geography==
Two routes from the [[Mediterranean]], lying through the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] gorge and the [[Beilan Pass]], converge in the plain of the [[Lake Amik|Antioch Lake]] (''Balük Geut'' or ''El Bahr'') and are met there by
#the road from the [[Amanian Gate]] (Baghche Pass) and western [[Commagene]], which descends the valley of the [[Karasu (Hatay)|Karasu River]] to the [[Afrin River]],
#the roads from eastern Commagene and the Euphratean crossings at [[Samosata]] (Samsat) and [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apamea Zeugma]] (Birejik), which descend the valleys of the [[Afrin River|Afrin]] and the [[Quweiq]] rivers, and
#the road from the Euphratean ford at [[Thapsacus]], which skirts the fringe of the Syrian steppe. A single route proceeds south in the Orontes valley.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}

==History==

===Prehistory===
The settlement called Meroe pre-dated Antioch. A shrine of the Semitic goddess [[Anat]], called by Herodotus the &quot;[[Achaemenid empire|Persian]] [[Artemis]]&quot;, was located here. This site was included in the eastern suburbs of Antioch. There was a village on the spur of Mount Silpius named ''Io'', or ''[[Iopolis]]''. This name was always adduced as evidence by Antiochenes (''e.g.'' [[Libanius]]) anxious to affiliate themselves to the Attic [[Ionians]]—an eagerness which is illustrated by the Athenian types used on the city's coins. Io may have been a small early colony of trading Greeks ([[Javan]]). [[John Malalas]] also mentions an archaic village, [[Bottia]], in the plain by the river.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}

===Foundation by Seleucus I===
[[Alexander the Great]] is said to have camped on the site of Antioch, and dedicated an altar to [[Zeus]] Bottiaeus; it lay in the northwest of the future city.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}} This account is found&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Antioch as a Centre of Hellenic Culture as Observed by Libanius|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fscXhWwDbusC&amp;pg=PA23 |year=2000|place=Liverpool|publisher=Liverpool University Press|others=Translated with an introduction by A.F.

But the story is not unlikely in itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebd&quot;&gt;[[Glanville Downey]], ''Ancient Antioch'' (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1963).

After Alexander's death in 323&amp;nbsp;BC, his [[Diadochi|generals]] divided up the territory he had conquered. After the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301 BC, [[Seleucus I Nicator]] won the territory of Syria, and he proceeded to found four &quot;sister cities&quot; in northwestern Syria, one of which was Antioch, a city named in honor of his father [[Antiochus (father of Seleucus I Nicator)|Antiochus]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblewise.com/bible_study/characters/syrian-pisidian-antioch.php|title=Syrian Antioch and Pisidian Antioch|publisher=Bible Wise|access-date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the ''[[Suda]]'', it might be named after his son [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suda|chapter=s.v. Ἀντιόχεια|url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;user_list=LIST&amp;page_num=1&amp;searchstr=seleukos&amp;field=any&amp;num_per_page=1}} At the Suda On Line project of the Stoa Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt; He is reputed to have built sixteen Antiochs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebd2&quot;&gt;{{Eastons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seleucus founded Antioch on a site chosen through ritual means. An [[eagle]], the bird of Zeus, had been given a piece of sacrificial meat and the city was founded on the site to which the eagle carried the offering.  Seleucus did this on the 22nd day of the month of Artemisios in the twelfth year of his reign (equivalent to May 300 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Malalas]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/malalas.html#199 Book 8, pp.199–202]&lt;/ref&gt; Antioch soon rose above [[Seleucia Pieria]] to become the Syrian capital.

===Hellenistic age===
The original city of Seleucus was laid out in imitation of the [[grid plan]] of [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] by the architect [[Xenarius]]. Libanius describes the first building and arrangement of this city (i. p.&amp;nbsp;300. 17). The citadel was on Mt. Silpius and the city lay mainly on the low ground to the north, fringing the river. Two great colonnaded streets intersected in the centre. Shortly afterwards a second quarter was laid out, probably on the east and by [[Antiochus I]], which, from an expression of [[Strabo]], appears to have been the native, as contrasted with the Greek, town. It was enclosed by a wall of its own.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}

In the Orontes, north of the city, lay a large island, and on this [[Seleucus II Callinicus]] began a third walled &quot;city&quot;, which was finished by [[Antiochus III]]. A fourth and last quarter was added by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (175–164&amp;nbsp;BC); thenceforth Antioch was known as ''Tetrapolis''. From west to east the whole was about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} in diameter and a little less from north to south. This area included many large gardens.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=130}}

The new city was populated by a mix of local settlers that Athenians brought from the nearby city of Antigonia, Macedonians, and Jews (who were given full status from the beginning). The total free population of Antioch at its foundation has been estimated at between 17,000 and 25,000, not including slaves and native settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebd&quot;/&gt; During the late Hellenistic period and Early Roman period, Antioch's population reached its peak of over 500,000 inhabitants (estimates generally are 200,000 250,000) and was the third largest city in the Empire after Rome and Alexandria. In the second half of the 4th century Libanius gives the figure 150,000 and John Chrysostom, 200,000 (without children and slaves counted)&lt;ref&gt;A.H.M. Jones, The Later Roman Empire, Vol. II 1984 pp. 1040 and 1409 {{ISBN|0-8018-3354-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} west and beyond the suburb Heraclea lay the paradise of Daphne, a park of woods and waters, in the midst of which rose a great temple to the Pythian Apollo, also founded by Seleucus I and enriched with a cult-statue of the god, as Musagetes, by [[Bryaxis]]. A companion sanctuary of Hecate was constructed underground by [[Diocletian]]. The beauty and the lax morals of Daphne were celebrated all over the western world; and indeed Antioch as a whole shared in both these titles to fame.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|pp=130-131}}

Antioch became the capital and court-city of the western Seleucid empire under [[Antiochus I]], its counterpart in the east being [[Seleucia on the Tigris]]; but its paramount importance dates from the battle of Ancyra (240&amp;nbsp;BC), which shifted the Seleucid centre of gravity from Asia Minor, and led indirectly to the rise of [[Pergamum]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

The Seleucids reigned from Antioch. We know little of it in the [[Hellenistic period]], apart from [[Syria]], all our information coming from authors of the late Roman time. Among its great Greek buildings we hear only of the theatre, of which substructures still remain on the flank of Silpius, and of the royal palace, probably situated on the island. It enjoyed a reputation for being &quot;a populous city, full of most erudite men and rich in the most liberal studies&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] ''[[Pro Archia]]'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; but the only names of distinction in these pursuits during the Seleucid period that have come down to us are Apollophanes, the Stoic, and one Phoebus, a writer on dreams. The nicknames which they gave to their later kings were Aramaic; and, except [[Apollo]] and [[Daphne]], the great divinities of north Syria seem to have remained essentially native, such as the &quot;Persian Artemis&quot; of Meroe and [[Atargatis]] of [[Hierapolis Bambyce]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

The epithet &quot;Golden&quot; suggests that the external appearance of Antioch was impressive, but the city needed constant restoration owing to the [[earthquake|seismic disturbances]] to which the district has always been subjected. The first great earthquake in recorded history was related by the native chronicler [[John Malalas]]. It occurred in 148&amp;nbsp;BC and did immense damage.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}&lt;ref&gt;[[John Malalas]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/malalas.html#207 Book 8, pp.207–208]&lt;/ref&gt;

Local politics were turbulent. In the many dissensions of the Seleucid house the population took sides, and frequently rose in rebellion, for example against [[Alexander Balas]] in 147&amp;nbsp;BC, and [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]] in 129&amp;nbsp;BC. The latter, enlisting a body of Jews, punished his capital with fire and sword. In the last struggles of the Seleucid house, Antioch turned against its feeble rulers, invited [[Tigranes the great|Tigranes of Armenia]] to occupy the city in 83&amp;nbsp;BC, tried to unseat [[Antiochus XIII]] in 65&amp;nbsp;BC, and petitioned Rome against his restoration in the following year. Antioch's wish prevailed, and it passed with Syria to the [[Roman Republic]] in 64&amp;nbsp;BC, but remained a ''civitas libera''.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

===Roman period===

The Roman emperors favored the city from the first moments, seeing it as a more suitable capital for the eastern part of the empire than Alexandria could be, because of the isolated position of Egypt. To a certain extent they tried to make it an eastern Rome. [[Julius Caesar]] visited it in 47&amp;nbsp;BC, and confirmed its freedom. A great temple to Jupiter Capitolinus rose on Silpius, probably at the insistence of [[Augustus|Octavian]], whose cause the city had espoused. A [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of Roman type was laid out. [[Tiberius]] built two long colonnades on the south towards Silpius.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

[[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and Tiberius enlarged the theatre, and [[Trajan]] finished their work. [[Antoninus Pius]] paved the great east to west artery with granite. [[Circus of Antioch|A circus]], other colonnades and great numbers of baths were built, and new [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]] to supply them bore the names of Caesars, the finest being the work of [[Hadrian]]. The Roman client, King Herod (most likely the great builder [[Herod the Great]]), erected a long ''[[stoa]]'' on the east, and Agrippa (c. 63&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}}12&amp;nbsp;BC) encouraged the growth of a new suburb south of this.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}&lt;!---whatever Herod needs linking (my strong guess is [[Herod the Great]], what other Herod had this power?, also the Agrippa time period is right)---&gt;

One of the most famous urban additions to Antioch, done by the Romans probably under Augustus when the city had more than half a million inhabitants, was the '''Circus of Antioch''': it was a Roman [[hippodrome]]. Used for [[chariot racing]], it was modelled on the [[Circus Maximus]] in [[Rome]] and other [[circus (building)|circus buildings]] throughout the empire. Measuring more than {{convert|490|m|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|30|m|abbr=off}} of width,&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphrey1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Humphrey|title=Roman Circuses: Arenas for Charioteers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=couetXBQO9AC&amp;pg=PA446|accessdate=25 August 2012|date=13 February 1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04921-5|pages=446–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Circus could house up to 80,000 spectators.

[[Zarmanochegas]] (Zarmarus) a monk of the [[Sramana]] tradition of India, according to [[Strabo]] and [[Dio Cassius]], met [[Nicholas of Damascus]] in Antioch around 13&amp;nbsp;AD as part of a Mission to [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 15.7.73 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:15.1.73].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv, 9].&lt;/ref&gt; At Antioch [[Germanicus]] died in 19&amp;nbsp;AD, and his body was burnt in the forum.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

An earthquake that shook Antioch in AD 37 caused the emperor [[Caligula]] to send two senators to report on the condition of the city. Another quake followed in the next reign.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

[[Titus]] set up the [[Cherubim]], captured from the [[Second Temple|Jewish temple]], over one of the gates.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

In 115 AD, during [[Trajan]]'s travel there during his war against Parthia, the whole site was [[115 Antioch earthquake|convulsed by a huge earthquake]]. The landscape altered, and the emperor himself was forced to take shelter in the circus for several days.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}} He and his successor restored the city, but the population was reduced to less than 400,000 inhabitants and many sections of the city were abandoned.

[[Commodus]] had [[Olympic games]] celebrated at Antioch.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

[[File:The Antioch Chalice, first half of 6th century, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Antioch chalice|Antioch Chalice]], first half of 6th century, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]
In 256 AD, the town was suddenly raided by the [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]] under [[Shapur I]], and many of the people were slain in the theatre.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}} It was recaptured by the Roman emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] the following year.

====Age of Julian and Valens====
When [[Julian the Apostate|the emperor Julian]] visited in 362 on a detour to Persia, he had high hopes for Antioch, regarding it as a rival to the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]]. Antioch had a mixed pagan and Christian population, which [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] implies lived quite harmoniously together. However Julian's visit began ominously as it coincided with a lament for [[Adonis]], the doomed lover of [[Aphrodite]]. Thus, Ammianus wrote, the emperor and his soldiers entered the city not to the sound of cheers but to wailing and screaming.

After being advised that the bones of 3rd-century martyred bishop [[Babylas of Antioch|Babylas]] were suppressing the oracle of Apollo at Daphne,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-09/npnf1-09-20.htm |title=St John Chrysostom's homily on Saint Babylas |access-date=2012-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706194336/http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-09/npnf1-09-20.htm |archive-date=2008-07-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; he made a public-relations mistake in ordering the removal of the bones from the vicinity of the temple. The result was a massive Christian procession. Shortly after that, when the temple was destroyed by fire, Julian suspected the Christians and ordered stricter investigations than usual. He also shut up the chief Christian church of the city, before the investigations proved that the fire was the result of an accident.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 22.12.8{{snd}}22.13.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates of Constantinople]], ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 3.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian found much else about which to criticize the Antiochene;  Julian had wanted the empire's cities to be more self-managing, as they had been some [[Antonines|200&amp;nbsp;years before]]. However Antioch's [[Decurion (administrative)|city councilmen]] showed themselves unwilling to shore up Antioch's food shortage with their own resources, so dependent were they on the emperor. Ammianus wrote that the councilmen shirked their duties by bribing unwitting men in the marketplace to do the job for them.

The city's impiety to the old religion was clear to Julian when he attended the city's annual feast of Apollo. To his surprise and dismay the only Antiochene present was an old priest clutching a goose.

The Antiochenes in turn hated Julian for worsening the food shortage with the burden of his [[billet]]ed troops, wrote [[Ammianus]]. The soldiers were often to be found gorged on sacrificial meat, making a drunken nuisance of themselves on the streets while Antioch's hungry citizens looked on in disgust. The Christian Antiochenes and Julian's pagan [[Gauls|Gallic]] soldiers also never quite saw eye to eye.

Even Julian's piety was distasteful to the Antiochenes even to those who kept the old religion. Julian's brand of paganism was very much unique to himself, with little support outside the most educated [[Neo Platonism|Neoplatonist]] circles. The irony of Julian's enthusiasm for large scale [[animal sacrifice]] could not have escaped the hungry Antiochenes. Julian gained no admiration for his personal involvement in the sacrifices, only the nickname ''axeman'', wrote Ammianus.

The emperor's high-handed, severe methods and his rigid administration prompted Antiochene [[parody|lampoon]]s about, among other things, Julian's unfashionably [[goatee|pointed beard]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ridebatur enim ut Cercops...barbam prae se ferens hircinam.'' [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] XXII 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian's successor, [[Valens]], who endowed Antioch with a new forum, including a statue of Valentinian on a central column, reopened the great church of Constantine, which stood until the Persian sack in 538, by [[Khosrau I|Chosroes]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

====Christianity====

[[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch was a chief center of early Christianity]] during Roman times.&lt;ref name=&quot;edwards&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W., &quot;Antioch (Seleukia Pieria)&quot; |title=The Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Early Christian Art and Archaeology, ed., Paul Corby Finney |date=2016 |publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing| location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8028-9016-0| pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city had a large population of Jewish origin in a quarter called the [[Kerateion]], and so attracted the earliest missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 11:19&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelized, among others, by [[Saint Peter|Peter]] himself, according to the tradition upon which the '''[[Patriarch of Antioch]]''' {{citation needed|date=December 2018}} still rests its claim for primacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|11|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly later&lt;ref&gt;Acts 11:22&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Barnabas]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] during Paul's first missionary journey. Its converts were the first to be called ''Christians.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|11:26|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with [[Antioch, Pisidia|Antioch in Pisidia]], to which the early missionaries later travelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|13:14–50|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrounding the city were a number of Greek, Syrian, Armenian, and Latin monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Byzantine Religious Culture: Studies in Honor of Alice-Mary Talbot, Alice-Mary Maffry Talbot, Denis Sullivan, Elizabeth A. Fisher, Stratis Papaioannou, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JulianusII-antioch(360-363)-CNG.jpg|thumb|250px|A bronze coin from Antioch depicting the [[Julian the Apostate|emperor Julian]]. Note the pointed beard.]]
The Christian population was estimated by [[Chrysostom]] at about 100,000 people at the time of [[Theodosius I]]. Between 252 and 300 AD, ten assemblies of the church were held at Antioch and it became the seat of one of the five original [[patriarchate]]s,{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}} along with  [[Constantinople]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Rome]] (see [[Pentarchy]]).

One of the canonical [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches is still called the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]], although it moved its headquarters from Antioch to [[Damascus]], Syria, several centuries ago (see [[list of Patriarchs of Antioch]]), and its prime bishop retains the title &quot;Patriarch of Antioch&quot;, somewhat analogous to the manner in which several Popes, heads of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] remained &quot;Bishop of Rome&quot; even while residing in Avignon, France in the 14th century.

'''Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East''', is an [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[Christian denomination|Church]] with [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|patriarchate]] founded by  [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]], according to its tradition. The Syriac Orthodox Church is part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], a distinct [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of churches claiming to continue the patristic and Apostolic Christology before the [[schism]] following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.

====Theodosius and after====
In 387 AD, there was a great sedition caused by a new tax levied by order of [[Theodosius I]], and the city was punished by the loss of its metropolitan status.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}} He divided the Roman Empire, and since then Antioch was under Constantinople's rule.
[[File:Antioch Alexandria and Seleucia.png|thumb|left|The Peutinger Map showing Antioch, Alexandria and Seleucia in the 4th century.]]
Antioch and its port, [[Seleucia Pieria]], were severely damaged by the [[526 Antioch earthquake|great earthquake of 526]]. Seleucia Pieria, which was already fighting a losing battle against continual silting, never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/se-sg/seleucia/seleucia_pieria.html Seleucia in Pieria, Ancient Warfare Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justinian I]] renamed Antioch '''Theopolis''' (&quot;City of God&quot;) and restored many of its public buildings, but the destructive work was completed by the Persian king, [[Khosrau I]], twelve years later, who deported the population to a newly built city in Persian Mesopotamia, [[Weh Antiok Khosrow]]. Antioch lost as many as 300,000 people. Justinian I made an effort to revive it, and [[Procopius]] describes his repairing of the walls; but its glory was past.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

During the Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628 the Emperor [[Heraclius]] confronted the invading Persian army of [[Khosrow II]] outside Antioch in 613. The Byzantines were defeated by forces under the generals [[Shahrbaraz]] and [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan]] at the [[Battle of Antioch (613)|Battle of Antioch]], after which the city fell to the Sassanians, together with much of Syria and eastern Anatolia.

Antioch gave its name to a [[School of Antioch|certain school]] of Christian thought, distinguished by literal interpretation of the Scriptures and insistence on the human limitations of [[Jesus]]. [[Diodorus of Tarsus]] and [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] were the leaders of this school. The principal local saint was [[Simeon Stylites]], who lived an extremely ascetic life atop a pillar for 40&amp;nbsp;years some {{convert|65|km|0|abbr=off}} east of Antioch. His body was brought to the city and buried in a building erected under the emperor [[Leo II (emperor)|Leo]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

====Arab conquest and Byzantine reconquest====
[[File:Fall of Antioch in 969.png|thumb|Recapture of Antioch in 969]]

[[File:AntiochRamparts.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s of Antioch climbing Mons Silpius during the Crusades (lower left on the map, ''above left'')]]
In 637, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]], Antioch was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] during the [[Battle of the Iron Bridge]]. The city became known in Arabic as أنطاكيّة ('''Anṭākīyyah'''). Since the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] was unable to penetrate the [[Anatolia]]n plateau, Antioch found itself on the frontline of the conflicts between two hostile empires during the next 350&amp;nbsp;years, so that the city went into a precipitous decline.

In 969, the city was recovered for the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] by [[Michael Bourtzes]] and the ''[[stratopedarches]]'' [[Peter (stratopedarches)|Peter]]. It soon became the seat of a ''[[Dux#Later developments|doux]]'', the civil governor of the homonymous [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]], but also the seat of the somewhat more important ''[[Domestic of the Schools]] of the Orient'', the supreme military commander of the imperial forces on the eastern frontier. Sometimes both offices were held by the same person, usually military officers such as [[Nikephoros Ouranos]], or [[Philaretos Brachamios]], who managed to retain the integrity of the eastern borderline after the Seljuk conquest of Anatolia. As the empire disintegrated rapidly before the [[Komnenian restoration]], ''Dux of Antioch'' &amp; ''Domestic of the Schools of the East'' [[Philaretos Brachamios]] held the city until the [[Seljuk Turks]] captured it from him in 1084. The [[Sultanate of Rum]] held it only fourteen years before the Crusaders arrived.

The Crusaders' [[Siege of Antioch]] conquered the city in 1098. At this time, the bulk of far eastern trade traveled through Egypt, but in the second half of the 12th century [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ed-Din]] and later [[Saladin]] brought order to Muslim Syria, opening up long distance trade routes, including to Antioch and on to its new port, [[St Symeon]], which had replaced Seleucia Pieria. However, the Mongol conquests of the 13th century altered the main trade routes from the far east, as they encouraged merchants to take the overland route through Mongol territory to the Black Sea, reducing the prosperity of Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades, Volume 3, The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades'', Cambridge University Press, 1955, pp. 326, 354–359&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1100, [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] became the [[regent]] of Antioch after his uncle and predecessor [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] was taken prisoner for three years (1100–03) by [[Gazi Gümüshtigin]] of the [[Danishmends]] at the [[Battle of Melitene]]. Tancred expanded the territory of Antioch by conquering [[Cilicia|Byzantine Cilicia]], [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], and [[Adana]] in 1101 and founding the principality, [[Lattakieh|Byzantine Latakia]], in 1103. In 1107 Bohemond enraged by an earlier defeat when he, allianced with Edessa, attacked [[Aleppo]], and [[Baldwin of Bourcq]] and [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] (Bourcq's most powerful vassal) were briefly captured, as well as the Byzantines recapturing of Cilicia and the harbor and lower town of Lattakieh, he renamed Tancred as the regent of Antioch and sailed for Europe with the intent of gaining support for an attack against the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/shorthistoryofan00boucuoft#page/n7/mode/2up |title=A short history of Antioch, 300 B.C.-A.D. 1268 |accessdate=2013-03-25|publisher=Oxford, Blackwell |year=1921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antioch (International Internet Preservation Consortium)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1107-1108, Bohemond led a 'crusade' against Byzantium, with the Latins crossing the Adriatic in October 1107 and laying siege to the city of Durazzo (in modern Albania), which is often regarded as the western gate of the Greek empire. Bohemond was outwitted by Alexius, who deployed his forces to cut the invaders' supply lines whilst avoiding direct confrontation. The Latins were weakened by hunger and proved unable to break Durazzo's defenses. Bohemond capitulated in September 1108 and was forced to accede to a peace accord, the [[Treaty of Devol]]. The terms of this agreement stipulated that Bohemond was to hold Antioch for the remainder of his life as the emperor's subject and the Greek patriarch was to be restored to power in the city. However Tancred refused to honor the Treaty of Devol in which Bohemond swore an oath, and it is not until 1158 that it truly became a [[vassal]] state of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Crusades The War For The Holy Land by Thomas Asbridge page 114 (p.3) to page 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir vol. 2, p. 320; Hillenbrand, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Antioch&amp;f=false The Crusades: Islamic perspectives], pp. 175–85&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after the [[Treaty of Devol]] Bohemond died, and Tancred remained regent of Antioch until his death during a typhoid epidemic in 1112.

After the death of Tancred, the principality passed to [[Roger of Salerno]], who helped rebuild Antioch after an earthquake destroyed its foundations in 1114. With the defeat of Roger's crusading army and his death at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis]] in 1119 the role of regent was assumed by [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]], lasting until 1126, with the exception from 1123 to 1124 when he was briefly captured by the [[Artuqids]] and held captive alongside [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]]. In 1126 [[Bohemond II of Antioch|Bohemond II]] arrived from Apulia in order to gain regency over Antioch. In February 1130 Bohemond was lured into an ambush by [[Leo I, Prince of Armenia]] who allied with the [[Danishmend]] [[Gazi Gümüshtigin]], and was killed in the subsequent battle, his head was then embalmed, placed in a silver box, and sent as a gift to the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades – Volume II.: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East: 1100–1187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian Kingdom in Cilicia during the Crusades: The Integration of Cilician Armenians with the Latins (1080–1393).&lt;/ref&gt;

Antioch was again ruled by a regency, firstly being Baldwin II, after his daughter and Bohemond II's wife, [[Alice of Antioch]] attempted to block Baldwin from entering Antioch, but failed when Antiochene nobles such as [[Fulk of Jerusalem]] (Alice's brother-in-law) opened up the gates for representatives of Baldwin II. Alice was then expelled from Antioch. With the death of Balwin in 1131, Alice briefly took control of Antioch and allied herself with [[Pons of Tripoli]] and [[Joscelin II of Edessa]] in an attempt to prevent [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem]] from marching north in 1132, however this attempt failed and Fulk and Pons fought a brief battle before peace was made and Alice was exiled again. In 1133 the king chose [[Raymond of Poitiers]] as a groom for [[Constance of Antioch]], daughter of [[Bohemund II of Antioch]] and [[Alice of Antioch|Alice]], [[kingdom of Jerusalem|princess of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Usmah Ibn Munqidh (1095–1188): Autobiography: Excerpts on the Franks, c. 1175 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage took place in 1136 between the 21-year-old Raymond and the 9-year-old Constance.

Immediately after assuming control, Raymond was involved in conflicts with the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] who had come south to recover [[Cilicia]] from [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo of Armenia]], and to reassert his rights over Antioch. The engagement lasted until 1137 when emperor John II arrived with an army before the walls of Antioch. Although the [[basileus]] did not enter the city, his banner was raised atop the citadel and Raymond was compelled to do homage. Raymond agreed with the emperor that if he was capable of capturing [[Aleppo]], [[Shaizar]], and [[Homs]], he would exchange Antioch for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''[[Annales Herbipolenses]]'', s.a. 1147: A Hostile View of the Crusade&lt;/ref&gt;

John went on to attack Aleppo with the aid of Antioch and Edessa, and failed to capture it, with the Franks withdrawing their support when he moved on to capture Shaizar. John returned to Antioch ahead of his army and entered Antioch, only to be forced to leave when [[Joscelin II, Count of Edessa]] rallied the citizens to oust him. In 1142 John then returned but Raymond refused to submit and John was forced to return to Cilicia again due to the coming winter, to plan an attack the following season. However the emperor died on April 8, 1143.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

====Second Crusade====

The following year after the death of [[John II Comnenus]], [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]] lay [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|siege to Edessa]], the crusader capital, and with the death of Imad ad-Din Zengi in 1146, he was succeeded by his son, Nur ad-Din Zangi. Zangi attacked Antioch in both 1147 and 1148 and succeeded during the second venture in occupying most of the territory east of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] including [[Artah]], [[Kafr Latah|Kafar Latha]], Basarfut, and Balat, but failing to capture Antioch itself. With the Second Crusades army previously nearly entirely defeated by the Turks and by sickness, [[Louis VII of France]] arrived in Antioch on March 19, 1148 after being delayed by storms. Louis was welcomed by the uncle of his spouse [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], Raymond of Poitiers.

Louis refused to help Antioch defend against the Turks and to lead an expedition against Aleppo, and instead decided to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the Crusades. With Louis quickly leaving Antioch again and the Crusades returning home in 1149,&lt;ref&gt;The Crusades: A Documentary Survey Brundage&lt;/ref&gt; Nur ad-Din launched an offensive against the territories which were dominated by the Castle of Harim, situated on the eastern bank of the Orontes, after which Nur besieged the castle of Inag. [[Raymond of Poitiers]] quickly came to the aid of the citadel, where he was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Inab]], Raymond's head was then cut off and sent to Nur, who sent it to the caliph in [[Baghdad]]. However, Nur ad-Din did not attack Antioch itself and was content with capturing all of Antiochene territory that lay east of the Orontes.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in the History of Relations between Orient and Occident in the Middle Ages.

====After the Second Crusade====
With Raymond dead and [[Bohemond III]] only five years of age, the principality came under the control of Raymond's widow [[Constance of Antioch]], however real control lay with [[Aimery of Limoges]]. In 1152 [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] came of age, but from 1150 he had proposed three different but respectable suitors for Constance's hand in marriage, all of whom she rejected. In 1153 however, she chose [[Raynald of Châtillon]] and married him in secret without consulting her first cousin and liege lord, Baldwin III, and neither Baldwin nor Aimery of Limoges approved of her choice.&lt;ref&gt;Les Familles d'Outremer&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1156 Raynald claimed that the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] had reneged on his promises to pay Raynald a sum of money, and vowed to attack the island of Cyprus in revenge. However Aimery refused to finance Raynald's expedition, so in turn Raynald had the Patriarch seized, beaten, stripped naked, covered in honey, and had him left in the burning sun on top of the citadel to be attacked by insects. When the Patriarch was released, he collapsed in exhaustion and agreed to finance Raynald's expedition.&lt;ref&gt;od's War: A New History of the Crusade&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Raynald had allied himself with the Armenian prince, [[Thoros II, Prince of Armenia|Thoros II]]. In 1156 Raynald's forces attacked Cyprus, ravaging the island over a three-week period, with [[Wiktionary:rapine|rapine]], killing, and plundering its citizens. After which, [[Manuel I Comnenus]] raised an army and began their march towards Syria, as a result Raynald threw himself to the mercy of the emperor who insisted on the installation of a Greek Patriarch and the surrender of the citadel in Antioch. The following spring, Manuel made a triumphant entry into the city and established himself as the unquestioned [[suzerain]] of Antioch.

In 1160 Raynald was captured by Muslims during a plundering raid against the Syrian and Armenian peasants of the neighborhood of [[Marash]]. He was held captive for sixteen years, and as the stepfather of the Empress Maria, he was ransomed by Manuel for 120,000 [[gold dinar]]s in 1176 (about 500&amp;nbsp;kg of gold, worth approximately £16 million or US$26 million {{as of|2010|October|lc=y}}). With Raynald disposed of for a long time, the patriarch Aimery became the new regent, chosen by Baldwin III. To further consolidate his own claim over Antioch, Manuel chose [[Maria of Antioch]] as his bride, daughter of [[Constance of Antioch]] and [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. But the government of Antioch remained in crisis up until 1163, when Constance asked the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] to help maintain her rule, as a result the citizens of Antioch exiled her and installed her son [[Bohemond III]] and now brother-in-law to the emperor, as regent.&lt;ref&gt;Religious and Military Crusader Orders in Syria in the 12th and 13th Centuries. Amman 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] captured Bohemond III when he defeated a joint Antiochene-Tripolitan army. Bohemond III was soon released, however [[Harem, Syria]] which Raynald had recaptured in 1158, was lost again and the frontier of Antioch was permanently placed west of the Orontes. Byzantine influence remained in Antioch and in 1165, Bohemond III married a niece of the emperor, [[Maria of Antioch]], and installed a Greek patriarch in the city, [[Athanasius II, Patriarch of Antioch]], who remained in his position until he died in an earthquake five years later.&lt;ref&gt;Seeing Islam as Others Saw

====Third Crusade====
On October 29, 1187, [[Pope Gregory VIII]] issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Audita tremendi]]'', his call for the Third Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Kelly, The Oxford Dictionary of Popes, New York: Oxford UP, 1986, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick I Barbarossa]], [[Richard I of England]], and [[Philip II of France]] answered the summons. With Richard and Philip deciding to take a sea route, Frederick lacked the necessary ships and took a land route where he pushed on through [[Anatolia]], defeating the Turks in the [[Battle of Iconium (1190)|Battle of Iconium]], however upon reaching Christian territory in [[Lesser Armenia]] ([[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]) the emperor drowned in the river [[Saleph]]. The emperor was buried at Antioch and the Germans became an insignificant contingent during the crusade. Throughout the Third Crusade Antioch remained neutral, however with the end of the Third Crusade (1192), they were included in the [[Treaty of Ramla]] between Richard and Saladin.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Alan and Charles L. Phillips, editors. &quot;Encyclopedia of Historical Treaties and Alliances, Vol. 1&quot;.

====Battles for sovereignty====
With no heir after the death of [[Raymond III, Count of Tripoli]] in the [[Battle of Hattin]] he left his godson, [[Raymond IV, Count of Tripoli]], the eldest son of Bohemond III. However Bohemond installed his younger, the future prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]], as count of Tripoli. Shortly after the end of the Third Crusade, Raymond IV, Count of Tripoli married [[Alice of Armenia]], the niece of Leo II, or [[Leo I, King of Armenia]], and a vassal to Antioch. Alice bore Raymond IV a son in 1199, [[Raymond-Roupen]], after which Raymond IV died in the coming months. In 1194 Leo II tricked Bohemond III making him believe that the new born prince had been captured by the Roupenians. Leo made a failed attempt at capturing Antioch believing the city would be weakened with the absence of Bohemond.

[[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] nephew to both Richard I and Philip II, travelled to [[Lesser Armenia]] and managed to persuade Leo that in exchange for Antioch, renouncing its overlordship to Lesser Armenia and to release Bohemond, who in 1201 died. With the death of Bohemond III there followed a 15-year struggle for power of Antioch, between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia. According to the rules of [[primogeniture]] Leo's great nephew Raymond-Roupen was the rightful heir of Antioch, and Leo's position was supported by the pope. However, on the other hand, the city commune of Antioch supported [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]], on the grounds that he was the closest blood relative to the last ruling prince, Bohemond III. In 1207 Bohemond IV installed a Greek patriarch in Antioch, despite the [[East-West Schism]], under the help of Aleppo, Bohemond IV drove Leo out of Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;A short history of Antioch, 300&amp;nbsp;B.C.-A.D. 1268 (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley-Smith, Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth Crusade and afterwards====
{{See also|Armeno-Mongol relations}}
In 1213 [[Pope Innocent III]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'' called for all of Christendom to lead a new (Fifth) crusade. This strengthened the support of [[sultan]] [[al-Adil I]] (العادل), an [[Ayyubid]]-Egyptian general who supported Raymond-Roupen's claims in Antioch. In 1216 Leo installed Raymond-Roupen as prince of Antioch, and ending all military aspect of the struggle between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia, but the citizens again revolted against Raymond-Roupen in c. 1219 and Bohemond of Tripoli was recognised as the fourth prince of that name. Bohemond IV and his son Bohemond V remained neutral in the struggles of the [[Ghibellines|Guelphs and Ghibellines]] to the south which arose when Frederich II married Isabella II, and in 1233 Bohemond IV died.

From 1233 onwards Antioch declined and appeared rarely in records for 30&amp;nbsp;years, and in 1254 the altercations of the past between Antioch and Armenia were laid to rest when [[Bohemond VI of Antioch]] married the then 17‑year‑old [[Sibylla of Armenia]], and Bohemond VI became a vassal of the Armenian kingdom. Effectively, the Armenian kings ruled Antioch while the prince of Antioch resided in Tripoli. The Armenians drew up a treaty with the Mongols, who were now ravaging Muslim lands, and under protection they extended their territory into the lands of the [[Seljuq dynasty]] in the north and the Aleppo territory to the south. Antioch was part of this Armeno-Mongol alliance. Bohemond VI managed to retake Lattakieh and reestablished the land bridge between Antioch and Tripoli, while the Mongols insisted he install the Greek patriarch there rather than a Latin one, due to the Mongols attempting to strengthen ties with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This earned Bohemond the enmity of the Latins of Acre, and Bohemond was excommunicated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Pope Urban IV]],&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, pp. 306–307. &quot;To the Latins at Acre Bohemond's subservience seemed disgraceful, especially as it involved the humiliation of the Latin Church at Antioch...Bohemond was excommunicated by the Pope for this alliance (Urban IV, Registres, 26 May 1263)&lt;/ref&gt; which was later suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Richard, The Crusades: c. 1071{{snd}}c. 1291, pp 423–426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ghazan resumed his plans against Egypt in 1297: the Franco-Mongol cooperation had thus survived, in spite of the loss of Acre by the Franks, and the conversion of the Persian Mongols to Islam. It was to remain one of the political factors of the policy of the Crusades, until the peace treaty with the Mumluks, which was only signed in 1322 by the khan Abu Said&quot;, Jean Richard, p.468&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fall of Antioch====
{{See also|Siege of Antioch (1268)}}
In 1259 the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] captured the Syrian city of Damascus, and eventually in 1260, Aleppo. The [[Mamluk]] [[sultan]] [[Saif ad-Din Qutuz]] looked to ally with the Franks, who declined. In September 1260, the Mamluks defeated the Mongols at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]], shortly after Qutuz was assassinated at [[Al-Salihiyya]], and according to various sources his successor [[Baibars]] was involved in his murder.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Maqrizi, p. 519/vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Perry (p. 150), Riley-Smith (p. 237, Baybars ... murdered Qutuz&quot;), Amitai-Preiss (p. 47, &quot;a conspiracy of amirs, which included Baybars and was probably under his leadership&quot;), Holt et al.&lt;/ref&gt; (Baibars &quot;came to power with [the] regicide [of Qutuz] on his conscience&quot; according to Tschanz.) Despite this, Baibars was named sultan, and in 1263 sacked Nazareth, threatened Antioch with invasion, and appeared before the walls of Acre. In January 1265 Baibars launched an offensive against the Latins, starting with Acre, the capital of the remnant of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], but was unable to take it, but defeated the Crusaders in many other battles in Arsuf, Athlith, Haifa, etc. And in 1268 Baibars besieged Antioch, capturing the city on May 18. Baibars promised to spare the lives of the inhabitants, but broke his promise and razed the city, killing or enslaving nearly the entire population upon their surrender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 Zahiriyya Madrasa and Mausoleum of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108224216/http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 |date=2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antioch's ruler, [[Bohemond VI of Antioch|Prince Bohemond VI]] was then left with no territories except the County of Tripoli. Without any southern fortifications and with Antioch isolated it could not withstand the onslaught of resurgent Muslim forces, and with the fall of the city, the remainder of northern Syria eventually capitulated, and ended the Latin presence in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/30*.html New scourge from Egypt], A History of Armenia by Vahan M.

==Archaeology==
[[File:Tyche Antioch Vatican Inv2672.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Týkhē'' (Fortune) of Antioch, Galleria dei Candelabri, the [[Vatican Museums]].]]

Few traces of the once great Roman city are visible today aside from the massive fortification walls that snake up the mountains to the east of the modern city, several aqueducts, and the [[Church of St Peter]] (St Peter's Cave Church, Cave-Church of St. Peter), said to be a meeting place of an [[Early Christian]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/turkey/antioch-cave-church-of-peter.htm|title=Sacred Destinations|accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Roman city lies buried beneath deep sediments from the Orontes River, or has been obscured by recent construction.

Between 1932 and 1939, archaeological excavations of Antioch were undertaken under the direction of the &quot;Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity&quot;, which was made up of representatives from the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], the [[Worcester Art Museum]], [[Princeton University]], [[Wellesley College]], and later (1936) also the [[Fogg Art Museum]] at [[Harvard University]] and its affiliate [[Dumbarton Oaks]].

The excavation team failed to find the major buildings they hoped to unearth, including [[Domus Aurea (Antioch)|Constantine's Great Octagonal Church]] or the imperial palace. However, a great accomplishment of the expedition was the discovery of high-quality Roman mosaics from villas and baths in Antioch, Daphne and Seleucia Pieria.

The principal excavations of Mosaics at Antioch led by Princeton University in March 1932 recovered nearly 300 mosaics. Many of these mosaics were originally displayed as floor mosaics in private homes during the 2nd through 6th centuries A.D., while others were displayed in baths and other public buildings. The majority of the [[Antioch mosaics]] are from the fourth and fifth centuries, Antioch's golden age, though others from earlier times have survived as well

One mosaic includes a border that depicts a walk from Antioch to Daphne, showing many ancient buildings along the way. The mosaics are now displayed in the [[Hatay Archaeology Museum]] in [[Antakya]]. A collection of mosaics on both secular and sacred subjects which were once in churches, private homes, and other public spaces now hang in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Frances F|title=Antioch Mosaics in Princeton|journal=Record of the Art Museum, Princeton University|date=1981|volume=40|issue=2|pages=2–26|jstor=3774611}}&lt;/ref&gt; and museums of other sponsoring institutions.

A statue in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] and a number of figurines and statuettes perpetuate the type of its great patron goddess and civic symbol, the [[Tyche]] (Fortune) of Antioch&amp;nbsp;– a majestic seated figure, crowned with the [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s of Antioch's walls and holding wheat stalks in her right hand, with the river Orontes as a youth swimming under her feet. According to [[William Robertson Smith]] the Tyche of Antioch was originally a young virgin sacrificed at the time of the founding of the city to ensure its continued prosperity and good fortune.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

On April 2016, archaeologists discovered a Greek [[mosaic]] showing a skeleton lying down with a wine pitcher and loaf of bread alongside a text that reads: &quot;Be cheerful, enjoy your life&quot;, it is reportedly from the 3rd century B.C. Described as the &quot;reckless skeleton&quot; or &quot;skeleton mosaic&quot;, the mosaic is once thought to have belonged in the dining room of an upper-class home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/archaeologists-discover-ancient-mosaic-with-message-be-cheerful-enjoy-your-life-a6998346.html Archaeologists discover ancient mosaic with message: 'Be cheerful, enjoy your life']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2016/04/22/2400-year-old-mosaic-found-in-southern-turkey-says-be-cheerful-enjoy-your-life 2,400 year-old mosaic found in southern Turkey says 'be cheerful, enjoy your life']&lt;/ref&gt;
