'''Pigeon shooting''' is a type of live bird wing shooting competition. Traditionally, there are two types of competition: box birds and columbaire. In box birds, the pigeons are held in a mechanical device that releases them when the shooter calls out. In columbaire, the birds are hand thrown by a person when called upon. The pigeons are bred for speed. The most common species of pigeon used in regulated shooting contests being known as a ''zurito'' (''[[Columba oenas]]''). In the shooting competition, large sums of money are gambled and winners can have purses exceeding US$50,000. The equipment for the sport can be specialized and purpose-built. 

In the past, the sport was popular worldwide. It was primarily a sport of the [[upper class]] and was held at resort locations such as Monaco and Havana. Popular magazines have covered the sport—for example, ''[[Field &amp; Stream]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' But, over time, the sport has fallen out of widespread favor due to costs, alternative shooting sports such as [[trap shooting]], [[skeet shooting]], and [[sporting clays]], and of course, animal rights activism over a blood sport. Proponents of the sport argue that live pigeons are more challenging to shoot than clay targets. Many claim that pigeon shoots are no more cruel than extermination efforts carried out in cities where [[feral pigeons]] are considered a nuisance and are often controlled using lethal methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillyvoice.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-clings-to-pigeon-shoots-that-have-nearly-vanished-nationwide/|title=Pennsylvania clings to pigeon shoots that have nearly vanished nationwide|date=5 June 2017|website=PhillyVoice|accessdate=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] euthanizes over 60,000 pigeons a year in response to complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/magazine/15pigeons.html|title=Pigeon Wars|first=Jon|last=Mooallem|date=15 October 2006|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Monte Carlo: 1872 to 1960 ===

Pigeon shooting in Monaco dates back to 1872. The ring was located behind the casino and was in continuous use with live pigeons until 1960, when robotic devices went into use. Slowly, shooting faded out of fashion, and the shooting range was demolished in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montecarlolegend.com/monte-carlo-a-history-of-extraordinary-sports/|title=Monaco: an extraordinary history of unusual sports|website=Monte Carlo Legend|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ring was demolished, a mosaic titled &quot;From the Earth to the Sea&quot; (&quot;De la Terre a la Mer&quot;) was installed by [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/vasarely1.html|title=History of Art: Victor Vasarely|website=www.all-art.org|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of pigeon shooting at Monte Carlo included creation of new types of gun stocks; the [[Stock (firearms)#Styles and features of stocks|&quot;Monte Carlo&quot; comb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7l6ZaZTjvBgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=pigeon+shooting+in+monte+carlo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HxzwUt2aUB&amp;sig=4ZzU-zAdwHbTM3KJF45rfdcOOd4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT0qOzptHRAhXpzIMKHfbSA_AQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=pigeon%20shooting%20in%20monte%20carlo&amp;f=false|title=Layne Simpson's Shooter's Handbook: 600 Questions Answered|last=Simpson|first=Layne|date=2005-02-24|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0873499395|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Pennsylvania===

Pigeon shooting in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania dates back to the mid-19th century.  The Philadelphia Gun Club overlooking the [[Delaware River]] in [[Bensalem, Pennsylvania]], is one of the oldest gun clubs in the United States. Founded in 1877 at the height of the [[Gilded Age]] the club opened to a many socially prominent gentlemen and their ladies. In 1895 the club acquired the historic Bickley Mansion for use as a club house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libwww.freelibrary.org/digital/item/42853|title=Digital Collections: Club House, Philadelphia Gun Club, Formerly Bickley Mansion.|website=Free Library of Philadelphia|accessdate=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club currently has 61 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;all-creatures.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-gun.html|title=Gun Club's Pigeon Shoots Ruffles Feathers|website=www.all-creatures.org|access-date=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club attracted many wealthy American sportsmen including several members of the [[Vanderbilt Family]]. [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]] and [[Harry Payne Whitney]] who married [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney|Gertrude Vanderbilt]] in 1896 were both members.  [[Edward Burd Grubb Jr.]] a former [[Union Army]] General, businessman and [[New Jersey]] politician who was appointed as [[United States Ambassador to Spain]] by [[Benjamin Harrison]], and was a close associate of [[Woodrow Wilson]] was an early president of the club.  In addition to the shooting range the club also had a [[boathouse]] on the river, and kennels for [[hunting dogs]]. [[Annie Oakley]] and her then employer, [[Buffalo Bill]] attended shoots at the Philadelphia Gun Club around the turn of the century. 

In 1928, outdoor writer and conservationist [[Nash Buckingham]], who contributed many articles to ''[[Field and Stream]]'', shot his famous A.H. Fox waterfowl gun, &quot;Bo Whoop&quot;, that had been custom built in Philadelphia by gunsmith Burt Becker at the club, as a guest of the magazine's publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaleditionsonline.com/article/The+Story+Of+Bo-Whoop/499833/47193/article.html|title=The Story Of Bo-Whoop|website=www.digitaleditionsonline.com|access-date=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1940s, club members and guests included notables such as writer [[Ernest Hemingway]], who also participated in live pigeon shoots in Europe and Cuba,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://app.tt.se/bildobjekt/image/sdlta2281bd|title=Hemingway Pigeon Shoot 1942|website=app.tt.se|access-date=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; and Canadian jazz musician [[Charles Biddle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;all-creatures.org&quot;/&gt;

The controversy surrounding live pigeon shoots at the Philadelphia Gun Club goes back more than a century. A club member was convicted for cruelty to animals for participating in a pigeon shoot in 1887. His conviction was eventually overturned by the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;animals24-7.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animals24-7.org/2017/09/07/did-hsus-humane-pennsylvania-sacrifice-pigeons-to-nra-demand/|title=Did HSUS &amp; Humane Pennsylvania sacrifice pigeons to NRA demand?|date=7 September 2017|website=Animals 24-7|access-date=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Pigeon shoots are also held at several other private gun clubs in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks]] and [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]] counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillyvoice.com&quot;/&gt;

For more than half a century, a public pigeon shoot was held every [[Labor Day]] in [[Hegins, Pennsylvania]].  Held annually from 1934 to 1998, this live pigeon shoot, known as the Fred Coleman Memorial shoot, once drew around 10,000 people. It was finally called off in 1999 following years of protests by animal rights activists and a legal battle that ultimately went all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillyvoice.com&quot;/&gt;

== Firearms and ammunition ==

Traditionally, live pigeon shooting guns were heavier than a regular field gun (greater than 7 pounds). Characteristics of them were longer barrels (30-inch with ventilated ribs give better sight plane), tighter [[Choke (firearms)|chokes]] (full/fuller), no safety, beavertail forend, single triggers, clipped fences, a third bite,&lt;ref name=&quot;Holt's Auctioneers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doublegunshop.com/ryder3.htm|title=doublegunshop.com The Quest for Quality - British game gun or British rifle|website=www.doublegunshop.com|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hallowellco.com/concealed_third_fastener.htm|title=Concealed Third Fastener|website=www.hallowellco.com|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.joeletchenguns.com/wing.htm|title=Wing Shooting and the Pigeon Ring|website=www.joeletchenguns.com|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; chambered for 2 3/4 inch 12 gauge shells instead of the 2 1/2-inch 12-guage shells that were commonly used for hunting in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These extra features were in place to handle the higher pressure loads used for live pigeon competitions where the bird had to be dropped inside the ring. Today, these pigeon guns command a higher premium at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardiner|first=Gavin|year=2010|title=Going, going, gun!|url=http://www.gavingardiner.com/documents/SHGZOCT2010PGS76-81.pdf|journal=Shooting Gazette|volume=|pages=76–81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pigeons used ==

In Europe, a special breed of rock pigeon is used called a ''zurito'' (''Columba oenas'') (see [[stock dove]]). They are small, gray, and exceptionally fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZuhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=zuritos+pigeon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cypskkeZ_Y&amp;sig=azXm4F9ekvV5Eho1sAeRmDY7EDY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp5JeDvtjRAhWM24MKHcYLDPIQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=zuritos%20pigeon&amp;f=false|title=Successful Shotgun Shooting|last=Montague|first=Andrew|date=|website=books.google.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Successful Shotgun Shooting|last=Montague|first=Andrew|publisher=The Derrydale Press|year=2000|isbn=1568331649|location=|pages=98|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States feral pigeons captured in urban areas such as [[New York City]], where they are considered a nuisance, have been used as targets for live pigeon shoots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2008/07/27/they-shoot-pigeons-dont-they/|title=THEY SHOOT PIGEONS, DON’T THEY?|first=James|last=Fanelli|date=27 July 2008|publisher=|access-date=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal rights criticism ==
Live pigeon shooting was once the sport of [[aristocrats]] in Britain, but was largely abandoned around the turn of the 20th century and sport was banned in the United Kingdom in 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;all-creatures.org&quot;/&gt; Opposition to the sport in the United States began in the late 19th century. In 1887 [[Women’s Humane Society]] and [[American Anti-Vivisection Society]] founder [[Caroline Earle White]] successfully prosecuted Philadelphia Gun Club live pigeon shooter A. Nelson Lewis.  Convicted of cruelty in January 1890, Lewis appealed his case all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which overturned the his conviction, ruling in 1891 that live pigeon shoots are a form of hunting and that pigeons are game birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;animals24-7.org&quot;/&gt; As early as the first quarter of the 20th century, editorial pieces began decrying the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/3rd-march-1928/18/pigeon-shooting-at-its-worst|title=PIGEON SHOOTING AT ITS WORST » 3 Mar 1928 » The Spectator Archive|newspaper=The Spectator Archive|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;John Goodwin, director of animal cruelty policy with The [[Humane Society of the United States]], has criticized pigeon shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/berks/animal-rights-advocates-fighting-to-end-live-pigeon-shoots_20160527123040474/19608518|title=Animal rights advocates fighting to end live pigeon shoots|last=LAKANA|date=2014-08-01|newspaper=WFMZ|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA live pigeon shooting remains legal but the popularity of the sport has waned considerably since the mid-20th century. It is specifically prohibited by statute in 14 states and has been determined to violate the [[animal cruelty]] statutes of nine more.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanesociety.org&quot;/&gt; In [[Pennsylvania]], where gun clubs have hosted pigeon shoots since before the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], live pigeon shooting is specifically exempt from animal cruelty laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;animals24-7.org1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;phillyvoice.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=SHARK|title=Cruel, Cowardly Pigeon Shooters Exposed!!!|date=2008-10-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D652zsCMDhU&amp;feature=fvw|accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/xconnect/v4/i2/t/leo.html|title=Teresa Leo - Pigeon Shoot|website=ccat.sas.upenn.edu|access-date=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;A 2014 bill for banning pigeon shooting&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bornfreeusa.org/legislation.php?p=4432&amp;more=1&lt;/ref&gt; was opposed by the [[National Rifle Association]].
