'''RS:X''' is a [[windsurfing]] class selected by the [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailing.org/olympics/history-part-5.php Olympic sailing report [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]]&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the [[Mistral One Design Class]] for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. The discipline has similarities to [[Formula Windsurfing]] - mainly in that the equipment used was designed to allow windsurfing in low and moderate wind conditions with good performance.

RS:X equipment includes a board with a [[daggerboard]], and a sail of a specified size. The board measures 286 cm in length and 93 cm in width. Unlike formula boards, it is quite heavy at 15.5&amp;nbsp;kg, which is almost twice that of regular competition formula boards, but is very similar to the weight of raceboards such as the previous Olympic board, [[Mistral One Design Class]].  The Mistral board has a weight of 17 kg ready to sail, while the RS:X board weighs more than 19 kg.

The RS:X seems to be a compromise between traditional raceboards which work well in {{convert|3|to|18|m/s|kn|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}}, and Formula boards which go fast in {{convert|12|to|30|kn|m/s|abbr=on|round=5}}, and has shown itself to be competitive with past raceboards in the medium wind range.

The shape and design of the RS:X sail is based on that of the [[Neil Pryde]] windsurfing sail V8.
