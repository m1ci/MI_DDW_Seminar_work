The place is of historical significance to Jains. Adipuran, a Jain religious text was composed here.

During the 9th century, Bankapura was named after ''Bankeyarasa'' (in 898 CE) who was a feudatory of [[Rashtrakoota]] king [[Amoghavarsha I]].

In the 16th century, the Bahamanis attacked Bankapur and Mustapha Khan of Bijapur annexed the fortress after 
a  pitched battle for more than a year. The Nawabs of Savanur and the Marathas ruled for a short duration before Hyder Ali and Tipu took possession. Later, Bankapura was ceded to the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
