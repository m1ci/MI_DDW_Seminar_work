'''Sironcha''' is a city and [[municipal council]] in [[Gadchiroli district]] of [[Maharashtra]] state in [[India]].

==Geography==
Sironcha is located at {{Coord|18.83|N|79.96|E|}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/2/Sironcha.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Sironcha]&lt;/ref&gt; It has an average elevation of 118&amp;nbsp;metres (390&amp;nbsp;feet).

There is a planned [[National Highway 16 (India)|National highway No 16]] between [[Karimnagar, Telangana|Karimnagar]] in [[Telangana State]] and [[Jagdalpur]] in [[Chhattisgarh]] State, [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]] states.  The construction of this National highway includes building bridges over the [[Pranahita River|Pranhita]] and [[Indravati River|Indravati]] rivers. The Tahasil is recently came into news for the discovery of  Dinosaur's fossils and large numbers of wood fossils found dating back to crores of years, specially lower Jurassic period.

==Historical background==
Historically Sironcha was a key location for the [[East India Company]] from
[[Nizam]] perspective, it was the Southern tehsil of Chanda District, 
[[Central Provinces]]. however it is not clear why Sironcha, a remote place,
was selected ?.  
In 1901, Sironcha tehsil area was {{convert|1,085|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}, and its population
was 51,148. The transfer of the taluks of Nugur, Albaka, and Cherla of the 
Sironcha tehsil, covering an area of {{convert|593|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} and containing 
142 villages with 20,218 persons, to the Madras Presidency has been 
sanctioned, but further details of administration are still being con- 
sidered. In 1905 an area of {{convert|2603|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} of the Chanda tahsil, 
of which 2,600 were in the Ahiri zamindari estate, was transferred to 
Sironcha. The revised totals of area and population of the Sironcha 
tahsil are {{convert|3095|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} and 55,465 persons. The population 
in 1891 of the area now constituting the tahsil was 51,732. The 
density is only {{convert|18|PD/sqmi|PD/km2|order=flip}}, and the tahsil contains 
421 inhabited villages. Its headquarters are at Sironcha, a village 
of 2,813 inhabitants, {{convert|130|mi|km|order=flip}} from Chanda town by road. The area 
of Government forest in the new tahsil is {{convert|480|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}, while {{convert|2254|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} of the Ahiri zamindari are covered by tree forest, scrub 
jungle, or grass. The northern portion of the tehsil comprised in the 
Ahiri zamindari is one of the most densely wooded and sparsely populated areas in the Province;
to the south of this Sironcha extends in 
a long narrow strip to the east of the Godavari, and consists of a belt of 
rich alluvial soil along the banks of the river and its affluents, with 
forests and hills in the background. The population is wholly Telugu. 
The land revenue demand of the tahsil was approximately Rs. 17,000, 
before the revision of settlement now in progress.
