== History ==
Anjangaon Surji is an ancient town having religious and historical importance. After the [[Battle of Assaye]] and the [[Adgaon#Battle of Argaon|Battle of Argaum]], the [[Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon]] was signed on 30 December 1803 at Anjangaon between the British and [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]], chief of the Maratha people. In 18th century Vithoji Narayan was awarded the vatandari of Anjangaon. There are records that he was awarded with a title 'Surji'. Anjangaon is mentioned as one of 46 Mahals of Vidarbha in [[Ain-i-Akbari]]. The revenue of Anjangaon as mentioned in Ain-i-Akbari was 32 lakhs. The river [[Shahanur River|Shahanoor]] on the banks of which Anjangaon is located, was historically named as Sharneera (meaning river generated by an arrow ). A popular story exists that during the year of banishment, [[Arjuna]] generated the water stream by hitting the soil by an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129359:2011-01-14-15-08-21&amp;Itemid=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devnath Math in Surji was established in 1754 AD. Saint Ruplal Maharaj established a famous Vitthal Mandir in this town. This is a city of betel leaves. Previously betel leaves were exported from here to Indonesia, Pakistan and Arabian countries. Now this place is known for cultivation of Piper nigrum, a medicinal plant.
