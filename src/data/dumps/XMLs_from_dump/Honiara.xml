'''Honiara''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|oʊ|n|i|ˈ|ɑːr|ə}}) is the [[Capital city|capital city]] of [[Solomon Islands]], situated on the northwestern coast of [[Guadalcanal]]. {{As of|2017}}, it had a population of 84,520 people.

==History==
The name Honiara derives from ''nagho ni ara'' which roughly translates as &quot;place of the east wind&quot; or &quot;facing the southeast wind&quot; in one of the Guadalcanal languages.{{Sfn|Room|2006|p=168}} The town has not been extensively documented and little detailed material exists on it.{{Sfn|Kupiainen|2000|pp=128–134}}

===World War II===
[[File:Aerial view of Henderson Field, Guadalcanal, in late August 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Henderson Field on [[Guadalcanal]] in late August 1942, soon after Allied aircraft began operating out of the airfield]]
The airport area to the east of Honiara was the site of a battle between the United States and the Japanese during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in [[World War II]], the [[Battle of Henderson Field]] of 1942, from which America emerged victorious.
The Battle of Henderson Field (1942), the last of the three major land offensives conducted by the Japanese during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] of [[World War II]] took place in what is now the airport area about {{convert|11|km}} to the east of the city centre. During the battle, the US Marine and Army forces, under the overall command of [[Major General]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]], repulsed an attack by the Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Japanese [[Lieutenant General]] [[Harukichi Hyakutake]]. {{Sfn|Degan|2003|p=125}} The US forces were defending the [[Lunga River (Solomon Islands)|Lunga River]] perimeter, which guarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, that had been captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. Hyakutake's force was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island. The Japanese landed with 3,500 troops but the force soon grew to over 20,000 personnel, roughly equal to America's 23,000; each side had about 13,000 troops.{{Sfn|Isom|2007|p=253}} 
[[File:GuadRidgeHenderson.jpg|thumb|right|Troops at the [[Battle of Henderson Field]]]]
From the top of Mount Austin at {{Convert|410|m}}, panoramic views of the north coastal plains, [[Savo Island|Savo]] and [[Nggela Islands|Florida islands]], and the battlefields of World War II can be seen. The Japanese held this hilltop in the second half of 1942 and showered artillery fire on American troops at the Henderson airfield below the hill. Eventually the hill was captured but the Japanese held on to the Gifu, Sea Horse, and Galloping Horse ridges for about a month. Most of the Japanese died of starvation, banzai assaults or direct killing.{{Sfn|Stanley|2000|p=873}}

Hyakutake's soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter. Along the [[Matanikau River]], the principal river flowing through what is now central Honiara, tanks attacked in pairs across the sandbar at the mouth of the river behind a barrage of artillery. Artillery, including {{convert|37|mm|1|abbr=on}} anti-tank guns, quickly destroyed all nine tanks. At the same time, four battalions of Marine artillery, totalling 40 howitzers, fired over 6,000 rounds into the area between [[Point Cruz]] and the Matanikau, causing heavy casualties in [[Nomasu Nakaguma]]'s infantry battalions as they tried to approach the Marine lines. Both sides incurred heavy losses during the events of the overall battle, especially the Japanese attackers.{{Sfn|Williams|2004|p=36}} After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] in November 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and [[Operation Ke|evacuated]] many of its remaining forces by the first week of February 1943. The [[Quonset hut]] built by the Americans can still be seen in the back lanes of the town and numerous memorials give testament to the war.{{Sfn||Hargis|2012|p=21}}

===Modern development===
Honiara officially became the capital of the British Protectorate of Solomon Islands in 1952. The infrastructure had been well developed by the US during the war which dictated the decision of the [[British Government]] to shift the capital to Honiara.{{Sfn|Stanley|2004|p=970}}{{Sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=258}} Government buildings opened in Honiara from early January in 1952. [[Robert Christopher Stafford Stanley|Sir Robert Stanley]] was based at Honiara during his time as [[High Commissioner for the Western Pacific]], which included the British Solomon Islands, the Condominium of [[New Hebrides]] (now [[Vanuatu]]) and the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] colony (now [[Kiribati]] and [[Tuvalu]]).{{Sfn|Gina|2003|p=48}} Dr. Macu Salato arrived in Honiara in early August 1954 and was based in the town, conducting surveys all across the islands and investigating [[leprosy]].{{Sfn|Kiste|1998|p=26}} He departed and returned to Fiji in late March 1955.{{Sfn|Kiste|1998|p=26}} 
[[File:Honiara (31811066544).jpg|thumb|Central business district]]
The town grew after Honiara became the capital city, receiving two-thirds of the allocations granted for the country's economic development in the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in substantial infrastructure development. Population growth was very slow and only about 5% of Solomon Islanders were living in the city. However, the [[Bellona Island|Bellonese]] population significantly increased; they established permanent and semi-permanent houses in the Honiara vicinity, typically along the banks of the White River.{{Sfn|Kupiainen|2000|pp=128–134}}  The town was affected by [[creolisation]].{{Sfn|Arends|Selbach|Cardoso|2009|p=51}} In the 1960s, [[Pijin]] became its principal language, and the mother tongue of a generation of young urban adults and children.{{Sfn|Kortmann|Schneider|p=692}} Through Honiara the language spread and has since become the main language spoken in the islands.{{Sfn|Kortmann|Schneider|p=692}}

[[Rhys Richards]], a New Zealand historian and former New Zealand High Commissioner of Solomon Islands, spent many years in Honiara.{{Sfn|Treadaway|2007|p=10}} In 1979 Honiara was still a small town in terms of population, especially for a capital city, with 18,346 people, of which 10,870 were men, and 7,476 were women.{{Sfn|Lemps|1984|p=66}} In July 1978, Honiara became the new capital of the independent Solomon Islands.{{Sfn|Stanley|2004|p=970}}

===Conflict===
An International Express Mail Agreement and regulations were signed between the United States and Solomon Islands governments in Honiara and Washington, D.C. on 19 April and 27 June 1991, coming into effect on 1 August 1991.{{Sfn|States|2007|p=244}} On 6 November 1998, a peace agreement was signed in Honiara between the United States and Solomon Islands governments.{{Sfn|States|2007|p=244}} However, since the late 1990s, Honiara has been the centre of ethnic violence and political unrest in the country.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} The area around Honiara was the battle ground of rival factions during the unrest as a result of the dominance of Malaitans, who were outsiders, and the local Guadalcanal islanders.{{Sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=258}}
A coup attempt occurred in June 2000 which resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (IFM). Violence was prevalent in the streets of Honiara, and although a peace agreement was made in October 2000, violence ensued in March 2002 when two diplomats from [[New Zealand]] and numerous others were murdered.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} Conditions became so bad in Honiara that in July 2003 Australian military and police units moved into the country to suppress the conflict, increase security, rebuild the damaged city and safeguard its shattered economic, political and legal institutions.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}}

In 2006, [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands#Riots following 2006 general election|riots]] broke out following the election of [[Snyder Rini]] as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; the large Pacific Casino Hotel was also totally gutted.&lt;ref name=McKinnon2009&gt;{{cite news|author=Spiller, Penny|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4930994.stm|title=Riots highlight Chinese tensions|work=BBC News|date=21 April 2006|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202134436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4930994.stm|archive-date=2 December 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to rubble and ashes.{{Sfn|Huisken|Thatcher||2007|p=92}} Three [[National Parliament of the Solomon Islands|National Parliament]] members, [[Charles Dausabea]], [[Nelson Ne'e]], and [[Patrick Vahoe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/third-solomons-mp-arrested-over-riot/2006/04/24/1145730850134.html?page=2|title=Third Solomons MP arrested over riot|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=24 April 2006|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104151646/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/third-solomons-mp-arrested-over-riot/2006/04/24/1145730850134.html?page=2|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; were arrested during or as a result of the riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The army part of [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI]] was removed and rebuilding took shape.&lt;ref name=Doing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitic.org.au/pdfs/bigs/solomons.pdf |format=PDF |title=Doing Business in the Solomon Islands |accessdate=24 September 2012 |publisher=pitic.org.au |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410143719/http://www.pitic.org.au/pdfs/bigs/solomons.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Solomon Islands-CIA WFB Map.png|right|thumb|Location of Honiara]]
Honiara is located on the northwestern coast of the island of [[Guadalcanal]] and includes a seaport at [[Point Cruz]]. The [[Matanikau River]] flows through the town, past Chinatown, badly affected by the 2006 riot. The town revolves around the Kukum Highway, which connects it with the [[Honiara International Airport]] (formerly known as [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]) about {{convert|11|km}} to the east of Honiara across the [[Lunga River (Solomon Islands)|Lunga River]]. To the west of the town center are the suburbs of [[White River, Honiara|White River]] and [[Tanaghai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;&gt;{{cite map|title= Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]], more specifically a [[tropical rainforest climate]], with an average daytime temperature of about {{Convert|28|C|F}}. Honiara is wetter between November and April. The average precipitation per year is about {{Convert|2000|mm|in}} and thus is lower than the average on the Solomon Islands as a whole ({{Convert|3000|mm|in}}). Honiara is subject to [[monsoon]]s.{{Sfn|Govan|1995|p=96}}

==Politics==
Honiara is divided into three [[Constituencies in Solomon Islands|parliamentary constituencies]], electing three of the 50 Members of the [[National Parliament of Solomon Islands|National Parliament]]. These constituencies (East Honiara, Central Honiara and West Honiara) are three of only six constituencies in the country to have an electorate of over 10,000. East Honiara, with an electorate of 30,049 in 2006, is the only constituency in the country with more than 20,000 voters. Following the [[Solomon Islands general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the city's representatives are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node/149|title=Constituencies and their Members of Parliament|publisher=National Parliament of Solomon Islands|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030200657/http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node%2F149|archive-date=30 October 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node/147|title=Listing of Members of Parliament by Political Parties|publisher=National Parliament of Solomon Islands|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030200644/http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node%2F147|archive-date=30 October 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy ==
Honiara developed economically at a much faster rate than other parts of Solomon Islands; during the 1960s and 1970s some two-thirds of the investment into economic development in the country went into developing the infrastructure of Honiara, despite the fact that at the time only some five percent of Solomon Islanders lived there. {{Sfn|Bennett|1987|p=326}} Like [[Tulagi]], the town did not grow substantially as a result of industrialisation.{{Sfn|Sofield|2003|p=194}}

Honiara is Solomon Islands' springboard for tourism activities. The country's tourist office, Solomon Islands Visitors Bureau, is on Honiara's main thoroughfare, Mendana Avenue. Situated between the Yacht Club and the Solomon Kitano Mendana Hotel, its officers provide tourist information and can radio ahead to announce visitors' arrivals to guest houses in the remoter areas. 
The violence which had plagued Honiara and the islands since the late 1990s had a devastating impact on the economy due to the fact that many tourist organisations around the world warned tourists wishing to visit the islands to stay away, especially in 2002 and 2003 at the peak of the troubles.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} In 1998, the country earned around $13&amp;nbsp;million from tourism and just $629,000 in 1999, equating to an average spend per visit of only US$254 (about US$35/day).{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} In 1999, tourism in the city and nation accounted for just 4.38% of the total GDP.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}}

Honiara Children's Park is a property of the Honiara Beautification Committee. The park, the only children's recreation area in Honiara, is located along the eastern coast of Honiara town as all other areas in the region are private property. According to a study, the park is in danger and needs to be protected as the coastline is subject to erosion; the erosion is recorded to be about {{Convert|6|-|8|m|ft}} between the old coastline and the eroded coastline.

The [[Woodford International School]], also called the International School, was initiated in the mid-1950s with about a dozen students. It was expanded under Solomon Islands' National Development Plan in the 1970s with the aim to attract investment and expertise into the country. In 1979, following independence in 1978 from the British rule, with British aid, new school buildings were built. The school was known as Honiara International School in September 1989 and took the name of Woodford International School in the 1990s. It is now a fully recognised independent education authority, and the government of Solomon Islands is only involved in providing a grant to the school.&lt;ref name=woodford/&gt; Since 2007, the management has started a programme of enhancing the building and other infrastructure facilities of the school to seek recognition as an &quot;[[International Baccalaureate]] World School&quot;.&lt;ref name=woodford/&gt;

==Culture==
In 1974, Polynesian Dances of Bellona (Mungiki), which included ''suahongi'' form, forbidden to be performed by the Seventh Day Adventist missionaries, was revived and recorded in Honiara. ''Suahongi'' is performed at the conclusion of the ritual of sharing in a ceremony called ''manga'e'', (performed by men) of the surplus harvest of fishing and garden crops. The dance is performed to rhythmic songs which are in the form of a &quot;feature call and response, speech–song&quot;, including the short history of the island of [[Bellona Island|Bellona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkways.si.edu/polynesian-dances-of-bellona-mungiki-solomon-islands/world/music/album/Smithsonian|title=Polynesian Dances of Bellona (Mungiki), Solomon Islands|publisher=Smithsonianfolkways.si.edu|accessdate=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514080438/http://www.folkways.si.edu/polynesian-dances-of-bellona-mungiki-solomon-islands/world/music/album/Smithsonian|archive-date=14 May 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Melanesia Arts and Crafts Festival was held for the first time in Honaria in 1998 when five Melanesian Countries participated.{{sfn| Stanley|2004|p=56}}
