Hunagund is connected with National Highway which connects between Maharashtra and Karnataka. Once the Hospet and Chitradurga Highway is completed, It would become one of the major stops. In the recent times a survey was conducted where there is a proposal to build railway track between Koppal and Alamatti. This would help reduce the travel time between Southern Capitals to Delhi by 6 hours. A major junction would be planned around this area. There is one more railway proposal between Bagalkot and Raichur. This would help in improving the connectivity between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
