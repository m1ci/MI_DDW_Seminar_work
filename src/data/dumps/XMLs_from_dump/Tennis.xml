'''Tennis''' is a [[racket sport]] that can be played individually against a single opponent ([[Types of tennis match#Singles|singles]]) or between two teams of two players each ([[Types of tennis match#Doubles|doubles]]). Each player uses a [[tennis racket]] that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber [[Tennis ball|ball]] covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's [[tennis court|court]]. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

Tennis is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including [[Wheelchair tennis|wheelchair users]]. The modern game of tennis originated in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], in the late 19th century as '''lawn tennis'''.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Baker (1988). &quot;Sports in the Western World&quot;. p. 182. University of Illinois Press,&lt;/ref&gt; It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as [[croquet]] and [[bowls]] as well as to the older racket sport today called [[real tennis]]. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term ''tennis'' referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis.

The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the [[Tiebreak (tennis)|tiebreak]] in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the [[line call]] of a point, a system known as [[Hawk-Eye]].

Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the [[Australian Open]] played on [[hard court]]s, the [[French Open]] played on red [[clay court]]s, [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] played on [[grass court]]s, and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] also played on hard courts.

[[File:Jeu de paume002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|''Jeu de paume'' in the 17th century]]
Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern [[France]], where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillmeister|first=Heiner|title=Tennis : A Cultural History|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=New York University Press|location=Washington Square, N.Y.|isbn=0-8147-3121-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill/page/117 117]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis X of France]] was a keen player of ''[[jeu de paume]]'' (&quot;game of the palm&quot;), which evolved into [[real tennis]], and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris &quot;around the end of the 13th century&quot;.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Paul B.|title=Daily life in the Middle Ages|year=2001|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-0897-9|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; In June 1316 at [[Vincennes]], Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either [[pneumonia]] or [[pleurisy]], although there was also suspicion of poisoning.&lt;ref name=Gillmeister&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillmeister|first=Heiner|title=Tennis : A Cultural History|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Leicester University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-7185-0195-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill/page/17 17–21]|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name.&lt;ref name=Gillmeister/&gt; Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King [[Charles V of France]], who had a court set up at the [[Louvre Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Moyer Heathcote |author2=C.

It was not until the 16th century that [[tennis racket|racket]]s came into use and the game began to be called &quot;tennis&quot;, from the [[French language|French]] term ''tenez'', which can be translated as &quot;hold!&quot;, &quot;receive!&quot; or &quot;take!&quot;, an [[interjection]] used as a call from the server to his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tennis |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=10 June 1927 |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. [[Henry VIII of England]] was a big fan of this game, which is now known as [[real tennis]].&lt;ref&gt;Crego, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XCl1c2yy5ooC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22real+tennis%22+and+tenez&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GrD8S8GtIcT68Abk173KBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22real%20tennis%22%20and%20tenez&amp;f=false Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th Centuries]'', page 115 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perris&quot;/&gt;

The invention of the first [[lawn mower]] in 1830, in Britain, is believed to have been a catalyst, for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins of the modern game ===
[[File:Tennis birthplace Edgbaston.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Augurio Perera]]'s house in [[Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]], where he and [[Harry Gem]] first played the modern game of lawn tennis]]
Between 1859 and 1865 [[Harry Gem]], a solicitor and his friend [[Augurio Perera]] developed a game that combined elements of [[racquets (sport)|racquets]] and the Basque ball game [[Basque pelota|pelota]], which they played on Perera's [[croquet]] lawn in [[Birmingham]] in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrylife&quot;&gt;Tyzack, Anna, [http://www.countrylife.co.uk/news/culture/article/79487/The_True_Home_of_Tennis.html The True Home of Tennis] ''Country Life'', 22 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Harry Gem Project|url=http://www.theharrygemproject.co.uk/|publisher=theharrygemproject.co.uk|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, [[Leamington Spa]].&lt;ref name=LTC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leamington-tennis-squash.co.uk/club-history|title=Leamington Tennis Club|accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where &quot;lawn tennis&quot; was used as a name of activity by a club for the first time. After Leamington, the second club to take up the game of lawn tennis appears to have been the Edgbaston Archery and Croquet Society, also in Birmingham.

In ''Tennis: A Cultural History'', Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on December 8, 1874, British army officer [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]] wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield) had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis “for a year and a half”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leamingtonrealtennis.co.uk/history-of-the-game/leamington-and-tennis.html Leamington Tennis Court Club]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called ''sphairistikè'' ({{lang-el|σφαιριστική}}, meaning &quot;ball-playing&quot;), and was soon known simply as &quot;sticky&quot; – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of [[Nantclwyd Hall]], in [[Llanelidan]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/sphairistik%C3%A9-anyone|title=Sphairistiké, Anyone?|magazine=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|author=E.

In the U.S. in 1874 [[Mary Ewing Outerbridge]], a young socialite, returned from Bermuda with a sphairistikè set. She became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching British army officers play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimsley|first=Will|title=Tennis: Its History, People and Events|year=1971|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-903377-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She laid out a tennis court at the [[Staten Island Cricket Club]] at Camp Washington, Tompkinsville, [[Staten Island]], New York.

There were different rules at each club. The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in New York.

On 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world&lt;ref&gt;[Heiner Gillmeister ''Tennis: A Cultural History'']&lt;/ref&gt; was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the [[United States Tennis Association]]) in order to standardize the rules and organize competitions.&lt;ref name=USTA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/communitytennis/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=95424&amp;icategoryid=437|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030214640/http://www.usta.com/communitytennis/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=95424&amp;icategoryid=437|archivedate=30 October 2007|title=History of United States Tennis Association|accessdate=29 May 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], was first held in 1881 at the [[Newport Casino]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ri.gov/facts/trivia.php|title=Fact &amp; History |work= Rhodes Island Government|accessdate=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2011.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/history.html|title=History of the U.S. National Championships/US Open|publisher=USOpen.org|accessdate=2 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603131646/http://2011.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/history.html|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), now the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF), was founded and established three official tournaments as the major championships of the day. The [[World Grass Court Championships]] were awarded to Great Britain.  The [[World Hard Court Championships]] were awarded to France; the term &quot;hard court&quot; was used for clay courts at the time. Some tournaments were held in Belgium instead. And the [[World Covered Court Championships]] for indoor courts was awarded annually; Sweden, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Switzerland and Spain each hosted the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bensen |first1=Clark |title=The World Championships of 1913 to 1923: the Forgotten Majors |url=http://www.tenniscollectors.org/journal/number30/tca30_text_p467.pdf |website=tenniscollectors.org |publisher=Journal of The Tennis Collectors of America |accessdate=5 September 2018 |location=Newport, RI, United States |page=470 |date=2013-2014 |quote=Number 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting held on 16 March 1923 in Paris, the title 'World Championship' was dropped and a new category of Official Championship was created for events in Great Britain, France, the United States, and Australia – today's Grand Slam events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bensen |first1=Clark |title=The World Championships of 1913 to 1923: the Forgotten Majors |url=http://www.tenniscollectors.org/journal/number30/tca30_text_p467.pdf |website=tenniscollectors.org |publisher=Journal of The Tennis Collectors of America |accessdate=5 September 2018 |location=Newport, RI, United States |page=470 |date=2013-2014 |quote=Number 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ITF: History |url=https://www.itftennis.com/about/organisation/history.aspx |website=ITF Tennis |publisher=International Tennis Federation |accessdate=5 September 2018 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact on the four recipient nations to replace the ‘world championships’ with ‘official
championships’ was simple in a general sense: each became a major nation of the federation with enhanced voting power and each now operated a major event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bensen |first1=Clark |title=The World Championships of 1913 to 1923: the Forgotten Majors |url=http://www.tenniscollectors.org/journal/number30/tca30_text_p467.pdf |website=tenniscollectors.org |publisher=Journal of The Tennis Collectors of America |accessdate=5 September 2018 |location=Newport, RI, United States |page=470 |date=2013-2014 |quote=Number 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the ILTF, have remained largely stable in the ensuing eighty years, the one major change being the addition of the ''[[Tiebreak (tennis)|tiebreak]]'' system designed by [[Jimmy Van Alen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&amp;hof_id=126|title=James Henry Van Alen in the Tennis Hall of Fame|accessdate=29 May 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153610/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&amp;hof_id=126|archivedate=30 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984. This reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then ITF President [[Philippe Chatrier]], ITF General Secretary David Gray and ITF Vice President Pablo Llorens, and support from IOC President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]]. The success of the event was overwhelming and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at Seoul in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Tennis Event|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/history/history/overview.aspx|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tennis and Olympics Love Affair|url=http://www.sportspundit.com/tennis/articles/1192-the-tennis-and-olympics-love-affair|publisher=SportsPundit.com|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment ==
{{Main|Tennis technology}}
Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a [[racket (sports equipment)|racket]] and balls.

=== Rackets ===
{{main|Racket (sports equipment)#Tennis}}
The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.

Under modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Technical&amp;nbsp;– Appendix II|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixii.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform.
* The frame of the hitting area may not be more than {{convert|29|in|cm}} in length and {{convert|12.5|in|cm}} in width.
* The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the rackets.
* The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.

The rules regarding rackets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For example, the maximum length of the frame had been {{convert|32|in|cm}} until 1997, when it was shortened to {{convert|29|in|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Technical&amp;nbsp;– The Racket|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/history/racket.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat are some of the more commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist.{{Example needed|date=September 2018}} The same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become more well known by the public.

=== Balls ===
{{main|Tennis ball}}

Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimsley|first=Will|title=Tennis: Its History, People and Events: Styles of the Greats|year=1971|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-903377-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/tennisitshistory00grim/page/14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern tennis balls are made of hollow [[vulcanized rubber]] with a [[felt]] coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]], and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as {{convert|65.41|–|68.58|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Balls must weigh between {{convert|56.0|and|59.4|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Rule 3 – The Ball|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/history/index.asp#2006|publisher=ITF|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the [[Far East]]. The relocation is due to cheaper [[labour costs]] and materials in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Balls- Manufacture|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/balls/other/manufacture.aspx|publisher=ITF|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/media/298557/298557.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis|publisher=International Tennis Federation|access-date=23 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.

{{For|individual terms|Glossary of tennis}}

=== Court ===
{{Main|Tennis court}}

Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 [[foot (length)|feet]] (23.77&amp;nbsp;m) long, and {{convert|27|ft|m}} wide for singles matches and {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}} for doubles matches.&lt;ref name=TCS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsknowhow.com/tennis/dimensions/tennis-court-dimensions.html|publisher=Sportsknowhow.com|title=Tennis court dimensions|accessdate=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than {{convert|0.8|cm|in|frac=3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=International Tennis Federation|title=ITF Rules of Tennis|url=http://assets.usta.com/assets/1/15/ITF%20-%20RoT%202010.pdf|work=United States Tennis Association Website|publisher=USTA|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m}} high at the posts and {{convert|3|ft|m}} high in the center.&lt;ref name=TCS/&gt; The net posts are {{convert|3|ft|m}} outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, {{convert|3|ft|m}} outside the singles court on each side.

The modern tennis court owes its design to Major [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]]. In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his [[Stické|stické tennis]] (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the [[hourglass]] shape of his court changed to a rectangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis court history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/courts/history.asp|title=Tennis court history&amp;nbsp;– Grass|publisher=ITF|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF court&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/facilities/facilities-guide/surface-descriptions.aspx|title=Surface Descriptions|publisher=International Tennis Federation|access-date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[grass court|Grass]], [[clay court|clay]], and [[hardcourt]]s of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. [[Artificial turf]] courts can also be found.

==== Lines ====
The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Court rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Rule 1 (The Court)|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line dividing the service line in two is called the center line or center service line. The boxes this center line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player's position, they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Rule 17 (Serving)|publisher=ITF|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon its first bounce. All lines are required to be between {{convert|1|and|2|in|mm}} in width, with the exception of the baseline which can be up to {{convert|4|in|mm}} wide, although in practice it is often the same width as the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Court rules&quot;/&gt;

=== Play of a single point ===
{{Main|Point (tennis)}}
The players or teams start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the ''server'', and the opposing player is the ''receiver''. The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players or teams. For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the center mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will [[Serve (tennis)|serve]], although the receiver must play to the pace of the server.

For a service to be legal, the ball must travel over the net without touching it into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a ''let'' or ''net service'', which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a &quot;foot fault&quot; when a player's foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit. If the second service, after a fault, is also a fault, the server ''double faults,'' and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service.

A legal service starts a ''rally'', in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server's court, before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel over the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.&lt;ref name=Terminology&gt;{{cite news|title=Tennis Terminology |publisher=cbs.com |accessdate=31 December 2011|quote=|url=http://www.cbssports.com/tennis/story/6145343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scoring ===
{{Main|Tennis scoring system}}
{{redirect|Break point|software term|Breakpoint}}

==== Game, set, match ====
===== Game =====
A [[Tennis score#Game score|game]] consists of a sequence of [[Point (tennis)|points]] played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as &quot;''love''&quot;, &quot;''15''&quot;, &quot;''30''&quot;, and &quot;''40''&quot;, respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as &quot;40–40&quot;, but rather as &quot;''deuce''&quot;. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is &quot;''advantage''&quot; for the player in the lead. During informal games, &quot;''advantage''&quot; can also be called &quot;''ad in''&quot; or &quot;''van in''&quot; when the serving player is ahead, and &quot;''ad out''&quot; or &quot;''van out''&quot; when the receiving player is ahead.
[[File:Final Score Andy Roddick vs Saulnier.jpg|thumb|The scoreboard of a match between [[Andy Roddick]] and [[Cyril Saulnier]].]]
The score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first. In tournament play, the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., &quot;''15-love''&quot;) after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score.

===== Set =====
A [[Tennis score#Set score|set]] consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6) a ''[[Tiebreak (tennis)|tie-break]]'' is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6. A &quot;love&quot; set means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a 'jam donut' in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Most Jam Donuts Served|url=http://www.tennis.com/stats/men_6-0.aspx|publisher=Tennis.com|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. &quot;6–2, 4–6, 6–0, 7–5&quot;.

===== Match =====
A [[Tennis score#Match score|match]] consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five ''sets'' system. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the [[Olympic Games]] and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match.&lt;ref&gt;From 1984 through 1998, women played first-to-win-three-sets in the final of the year-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]].&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the final sets of matches at the [[French Open]], the Olympic Games, and [[Fed Cup]] are tie-breaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some [[Longest tennis match records|remarkably long matches]].

In tournament play, the chair [[Referee|umpire]] announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase &quot;''Game, set, match''&quot; followed by the winning person's or team's name.

==== Special point terms ====
===== Game point =====
{{anchor|game point|set point|match point|championship point}}A ''game point'' occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.

===== Break point =====
A ''break point'' occurs if the receiver, not the [[Serve (tennis)|server]], has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because [[Serve (tennis)|serving]] is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has ''break point'', ''double break point'' or ''triple break point'', respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have ''converted'' their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a ''failure to convert.'' Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as ''breaking serve'', as the receiver has disrupted, or ''broken'' the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as ''breaking back''. Except where [[Tennis score#Scoring a tiebreak game|tie-breaks]] apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set.

=== Rule variations ===
{{See also|Types of tennis match}}

* '''No ad'''
: From 'No advantage'. Scoring method created by [[Jimmy Van Alen]]. The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by [[World Team Tennis]] professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTT Firsts &amp; Innovations|url=http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=626|publisher=WTT.com|accessdate=3 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225082726/http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=626|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Procedures and Scoring Methods|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixiv.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pro set'''
: Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one &quot;pro set&quot;. A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. A 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 8–8 (or 10–10). These are often played with no-ad scoring.

* '''Match tie-break'''
: This is sometimes played instead of a third set. A match tie-break (also called ''super tie-break'') is played like a regular tie-break, but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. Match tie-breaks are used in the [[Hopman Cup]], Grand Slams (excluding [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]) and the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] for mixed doubles; on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] (since 2006), [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] (since 2007) and [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] (excluding four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and the [[Davis Cup]]) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.

* '''Fast4'''
: [[Fast4 Tennis|Fast4]] is a shortened format that offers a &quot;fast&quot; alternative, with four points, four games and four rules: there are no advantage scores, lets are played, tie-breakers apply at three games all and the first to four games wins the set.

Another, however informal, tennis format is called [[Canadian doubles]]. This involves three players, with one person playing a doubles team. The single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring is the same as a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body.

&quot;Australian doubles&quot;, another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the [[Canadian doubles]] style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve.

[[Wheelchair tennis]] can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. An extra bounce is permitted. This rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able-bodied matches. It is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an able-bodied player (referred to as &quot;one-up, one-down&quot;), or for a wheelchair player to play against an able-bodied player. In such cases, the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only.

== Officials ==
[[File:Tennis umpire.jpg|thumb|An [[Referee|umpire]] informing two players of the rules]]
{{Main|Official (tennis)}}

In most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair [[Referee|umpire]] (usually referred to as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made.&lt;ref name=officials&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf|title=ITF Rules of Tennis&amp;nbsp;– Appendix V (Role of Court Officials)|publisher=ITF|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some tournaments, line judges who would be calling the serve, were assisted by [[Electronic line judge|electronic sensors]] that beeped to indicate the serve was out. This system was called &quot;[[Cyclops (computer system)|Cyclops]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyclops and speed guns|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/tennis/features/newsid_3001000/3001768.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2012|date=20 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclops has since largely been replaced by the [[Hawk-Eye]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cyclops knocked off centre as Wimbledon adopts Hawkeye |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/24/tennis |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=6 May 2012 |date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hawk-eye Vision |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/27/tennis-hawk-eye?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=6 May 2012 |first=Richard |last=Evans|date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tie-break to challenge close [[line call]]s by means of an [[instant replay|electronic review]]. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], [[Miami Masters]], [[United States Open Series|US Open Series]], and [[World Team Tennis]] started using this challenge system in 2006 and the [[Australian Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] introduced the system in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History Of Hawk-Eye|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/page/OffCourtNews/Read/0,,12781~2475719,00.html|publisher=WTA Tour|accessdate=6 September 2012|date=7 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124064901/http://www.wtatennis.com/page/OffCourtNews/Read/0,,12781~2475719,00.html|archive-date=24 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clay-court matches, such as at the [[French Open]], a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball's impact on the court surface.

The referee, who is usually located off the court, is the final authority about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision. (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair).&lt;ref name=officials/&gt;

[[Ball boy|Ball boys and girls]] may be employed to retrieve balls, pass them to the players, and hand players their towels. They have no [[adjudicative]] role. In rare events (e.g., if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance), the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. The umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. In some leagues, especially junior leagues, players make their own calls, trusting each other to be honest. This is the case for many school and university level matches. The referee or referee's assistant, however, can be called on court at a player's request, and the referee or assistant may change a player's call. In unofficiated matches, a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out.

== Junior tennis ==
{{Main|Junior tennis}}

In tennis, a junior is a player under 18 who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.

The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) or [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. Some juniors, however, such as Australian [[Lleyton Hewitt]] and Frenchman [[Gaël Monfils]], have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.

In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Announce Combined Junior Rankings|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_1693_original.PDF|publisher=ITF|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Junior tournaments do not offer [[prize money]] except for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam tournaments]], which are the most prestigious junior events. Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A.

Leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the [[Junior Davis Cup and Junior Fed Cup|Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup]] competitions. To succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age. To facilitate and nurture a junior's growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play. Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.

=== Continuity ===
A tennis match is intended to be continuous.&lt;ref name=ITF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_30333_original.PDF|title=The ITF states this in Rule No. 29|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because stamina is a relevant factor, arbitrary delays are not permitted. In most cases, service is required to occur no more than 20 seconds after the end of the previous point.&lt;ref name=ITF/&gt; This is increased to 90 seconds when the players change ends (after every odd-numbered game), and a 2-minute break is permitted between sets.&lt;ref name=ITF/&gt; Other than this, breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players' control, such as rain, damaged footwear, damaged racket, or the need to retrieve an errant ball. Should a player be determined to be stalling repeatedly, the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of &quot;point&quot;, &quot;game&quot;, and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/109832/109832.pdf|publisher=ITF|title=Code of Conduct for 2012 ITF Pro Circuits Tournaments|quote=The first violation of this Section shall be penalised by a Time Violation warning and each subsequent violation shall be penalised by the assessment of one Time Violation point penalty.|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a rain delay, darkness or other external conditions halting play, the match is resumed at a later time, with the same score as at the time of the delay, and the players at the same end of the court when rain halted play, or at the same position (north or south) if play is resumed on a different court.

Balls wear out quickly in serious play and, therefore, in [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments, they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games, because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up.&lt;ref name=ball/&gt; The exception to this is that a ball change may not take place at the beginning of a tiebreaker, in which case the ball change is delayed until the beginning of the second game of the next set.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Rules&quot; /&gt; As a courtesy to the receiver, the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls. However, in [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tournaments like [[Fed Cup]], the balls are changed in a 9–11 style. Continuity of the balls' condition is considered part of the game, so if a re-warm-up is required after an extended break in play (usually due to rain), then the re-warm-up is done using a separate set of balls, and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes.

=== On-court coaching ===
A recent rule change is to allow coaching on court on a limited basis during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expert-tennis-tips.com/tennis-on-court-coaching.html |publisher=Expert-tennis-tips.com|title=Tennis On-Court Coaching}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/USTA/Global/Improve_Your_Game/Archive/Tennis_Tips/Rules_and_Line_Calls/Coaching_during_a_match.aspx|publisher=USTA|title=Coaching during a match|accessdate=7 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505073501/http://www.usta.com/USTA/Global/Improve_Your_Game/Archive/Tennis_Tips/Rules_and_Line_Calls/Coaching_during_a_match.aspx|archive-date=5 May 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5441281 |title=Tennis Coaching Debate |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2620446 |title=Does on-court coaching have a future? |publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been introduced in women's tennis for [[WTA Tour]] events in 2009 and allows the player to request her coach once per set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/SEWTATour-Archive/Archive/AboutTheTour/rules.pdf WTA 2012 Official Rulebook] Chapter XVII/H&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stance ==
Stance refers to the way a player prepares themselves in order to best be able to return a shot. Essentially, it enables them to move quickly in order to achieve a particular stroke. There are four main stances in modern tennis: open, semi-open, closed, and neutral. All four stances involve the player crouching in some manner: as well as being a more efficient striking posture, it allows them to [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles in order to play the stroke more dynamically. What stance is selected is strongly influenced by shot selection. A player may quickly alter their stance depending on the circumstances and the type of shot they intend to play. Any given stance also alters dramatically based upon the actual playing of the shot with dynamic movements and shifts of body weight occurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis Stances&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.optimumtennis.net/tennis-stances.htm |title=Tennis Stances |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis Techniques for Beginners&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.optimumtennis.net/tennis-techniques-for-beginners.htm |title=Tennis Techniques for Beginners |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open stance ===
This is the most common stance in tennis. The player’s feet are placed parallel to the net. They may be pointing sideways, directly at the net or diagonally towards it. This stance allows for a high degree of torso rotation which can add significant power to the stroke. This process is sometimes likened to the coiling and uncoiling of a spring. i.e the torso is rotated as a means of preloading the muscular system in preparation for playing the stroke: this is the coiling phase. When the stroke is played the torso rotates to face forwards again, called uncoiling, and adds significant power to the stroke. A disadvantage of this stance is that it does not always allow ‘for proper weight transfer and maintenance of balance’&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis Stances&quot;/&gt; when making powerful strokes. It is commonly used for forehand strokes; double-handed backhands can also be made effectively from it.

=== Semi-open stance ===
This stance is somewhere between open and closed and is a very flexible stance. The feet are aligned diagonally towards the net. It allows for a lot of shoulder rotation and the torso can be coiled, before being uncoiled into the shot in order to increase the power of the shot. It is commonly used in modern tennis especially by ‘top professional players on the forehand’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.optimumtennis.net/tennis-stances.htm |title=Tennis Stances |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-handed backhands can also be employed from this stance.

=== Closed stance ===
The closed stance is the least commonly used of the three main stances. One foot is placed further towards the net with the other foot further from it; there is a diagonal alignment between the feet.  It allows for effective torso rotation in order to increase the power of the shot. It is usually used to play backhand shots and it is rare to see forehand shots played from it. A stroke from this stance may entail the rear foot coming completely off the floor with bodyweight being transferred entirely to the front foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis Stances&quot;/&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis Techniques for Beginners&quot;/&gt;

=== Neutral stance ===
This is sometimes also referred to as the square stance. One foot is positioned closer to the net and ahead of the other which is  behind and in line with it. Both feet are aligned at a 90 degree angle to the net. The neutral stance is often taught early because ‘It allows beginners to learn about shifting weight and rotation of the body.’&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis Techniques for Beginners&quot;/&gt; Forehands and backhands may be made from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://woooiii.com/tennis-footwork-different-hitting-stances-explained/ |title=Tennis Footwork: Different Hitting Stances Explained |date=March 27, 2019 |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shots ==
{{Main|Tennis shots}}
A competent tennis player has eight basic shots in his or her repertoire: the serve, forehand, backhand, volley, half-volley, overhead smash, drop shot, and lob.

=== Grip ===
{{Main|Grip (Tennis)}}
A grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a match. The grip affects the angle of the racket face when it hits the ball and influences the pace, spin, and placement of the shot. Players use various grips during play, including the Continental (The &quot;Handshake Grip&quot;), Eastern (Can be either semi-eastern or full eastern. Usually used for backhands.), and Western (semi-western or full western, usually for forehand grips) grips. Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting; for example, slice shots and serves call for a Continental grip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grip Guide&amp;nbsp;— A Grip on Your Game|url=http://www.tennis.com/articles/templates/instruction.aspx?articleid=1337|publisher=Tennis.com|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serve ===
{{Main|Serve (tennis)}}
[[File:Paraguay stamp - Martina Navrátilová.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Paraguayan stamp depicting a [[Martina Navratilova]] service motion.]]
A serve (or, more formally, a &quot;service&quot;) in tennis is a shot to start a point. The serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chang refused to lose 20 years ago|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french09/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&amp;id=4173388|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a &quot;let&quot; and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Rules&quot; /&gt; If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.

Experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve, topspin serve, slice serve, and kick (American twist) serve. A reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server, the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness. If the ball is spinning counterclockwise, it will curve right from the hitter's point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/skills/4229090.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2012|date=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an &quot;ace&quot;.

=== Forehand ===
{{Main|Forehand}}
For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. There are various [[Grip (tennis)|grips]] for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the ''continental'', the ''eastern'', the ''semi-western'', and the ''western''. For a number of years, the small, frail 1920s player [[Bill Johnston (tennis)|Bill Johnston]] was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a ''western'' grip. Few top players used the ''western'' grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the ''western'' forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player [[Pancho Segura]] used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. Players such as [[Monica Seles]] or France's [[Fabrice Santoro]] and [[Marion Bartoli]] are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two-handed Forehand Revisited|url=http://www.tennisone.com/magazine/iwells/07/smith/2-fh/2fh.php|publisher=TennisONE|accessdate=6 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511130748/http://www.tennisone.com/magazine/iwells/07/smith/2-fh/2fh.php|archive-date=11 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backhand ===
{{Main|Backhand}}
[[File:Canada 2010 Andy Murray Backhand.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Andy Murray]] hitting a two-handed backhand.]]
For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. For most of the 20th century, the backhand was performed with one hand, using either an ''eastern'' or a ''continental'' grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians [[Vivian McGrath]] and [[John Bromwich]], but they were lonely exceptions. The two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as [[Björn Borg]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Jimmy Connors]], and later [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Marat Safin]] used it to great effect, and it is now used by a large number of the world's best players, including [[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Serena Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two-Handed is Superior to One-Handed Backhand|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_27759_original.PDF|publisher=ITF|accessdate=6 May 2012|author=Damir Popadic|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two hands give the player more control, while one hand can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with the two-handed shot. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, [[Don Budge]], had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. [[Ken Rosewall]], another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably [[Monica Seles]], use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.

=== Other shots ===
A ''[[volley (tennis)|volley]]'' is a shot returned to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces, generally performed near the net, and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court. The ''[[half volley]]'' is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, also generally in the vicinity of the net, and played with the racket close to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grasso|first=John|title=Historical Dictionary of Tennis|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-7237-0|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''swinging volley'' is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. It is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent, as it returns the ball into the opponent's court much faster than a standard volley.

From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the ''[[lob (tennis)|lob]]'' can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near the net may then hit an ''[[smash (tennis)|overhead smash]]'', a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point.

A difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. When the contact point is higher than the reach of a two-handed backhand, most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways). Fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash. Rarely, a player will go for a high topspin backhand, while themselves in the air. A successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing, with less margin of error than the lower contact point backhands, since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.

If an opponent is deep in his court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected ''[[drop shot]]'', by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it. Advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot, causing the ball to &quot;skid&quot; upon landing and bounce sideways, with less forward momentum toward their opponent, or even backwards towards the net, thus making it even more difficult to return.

== Injuries ==
{{Main|Tennis injuries}}
Muscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epidemiology of musculoskeletal injury in the tennis player|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/46/7/492|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 1 June 2012|issn =  1473-0480|pmid = 22554841|pages = 492–498|volume = 46|issue = 7|doi = 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091164|first = Geoffrey D.|last = Abrams|first2 = Per A.|last2 = Renstrom|first3 = Marc R.|last3 = Safran}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount of pressure to the lengthened muscle, [[muscle strain]] can occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Joint structure and function: A comprehensive analysis (5th ed.).|last = Levangie, P.

== Tournaments ==
{{See also|List of tennis tournaments}}
[[File:Centre Court.jpg|thumb|right|A tennis match at Centre Court in the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in [[2007 Wimbledon Championship|2007]]]]
Tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be organized for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Example of this include the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] and [[Les Petits As]] junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as [[wheelchair tennis]] and deaf tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lta.org.uk/PlayAndCompete/DisabilityTennis/DisabilityTennisHearing.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205021146/http://www.lta.org.uk/PlayAndCompete/DisabilityTennis/DisabilityTennisHearing.htm|archivedate=5 February 2008|title=Lawn Tennis Association Deaf tennis|accessdate=16 March 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, the singles draws are limited to 128 players for each gender.

Most large tournaments [[Seed (sports)|seed]] players, but players may also be matched by their skill level. According to how well a person does in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is adjusted periodically to maintain competitive matches. For example, the [[United States Tennis Association]] administers the National Tennis Rating Program ([[United States Tennis Association#NTRP Ratings|NTRP]]), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this system would rate 3.0–4.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale.

=== Grand Slam tournaments ===
The four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world. They are held annually and comprise, in chronological order, the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]], [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Apart from the [[Olympic Games]], [[Davis Cup]], [[Fed Cup]], and [[Hopman Cup]], they are the only tournaments regulated by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF).&lt;ref name=Slams&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/about/grand-slams/overview.aspx|publisher=ITF|title=Grand Slams Overview|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITF's national associations, [[Tennis Australia]] (Australian Open), the [[Fédération Française de Tennis]] (French Open), the [[Lawn Tennis Association]] (Wimbledon) and the [[United States Tennis Association]] (US Open) are delegated the responsibility to organize these events.&lt;ref name=Slams/&gt;

Aside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters 1000]] (men) and [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier events]] (women).&lt;ref name=Rankings&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Rankings FAQ|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx|publisher=ATP|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/Pdfs/rankings/howitworks.pdf|title=WTA Tour Rankings|accessdate=16 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119124913/http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonyericssonwtatour.com%2F3%2Fglobal%2FPdfs%2Frankings%2Fhowitworks.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw. There are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament. This draw is composed of 32 seeded players, other players ranked in the world's top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive invitations through [[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]. Grand Slam men's tournaments have best-of-five set matches while the women play best-of-three. Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks, the others being the [[BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Masters]] and the [[Sony Ericsson Open|Miami Masters]].

Currently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have [[Types of tennis match|mixed doubles]] contests. Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and [[junior tennis]] competitions. These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies. For example, players at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white. [[Andre Agassi]] chose to skip Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 citing the event's traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly white&quot; dress code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4088298.stm | title = What not to wear at Wimbledon | work = [[BBC Sport]] |author = Sarah Holt | date = 15 June 2005 | accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wimbledon has its own particular methods for disseminating tickets, often leading tennis fans to follow complex procedures to obtain tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledondebentureholders.com/articles/ten_ways_to_grab_a_seat_at_wimbledon |title=10 Ways to Grab a Seat at Wimbledon 2010 |publisher=Wimbledondebentureholders.com |accessdate=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615193839/http://www.wimbledondebentureholders.com/articles/ten_ways_to_grab_a_seat_at_wimbledon |archive-date=15 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;* The international tournament began in 1925&lt;/small&gt;

=== Men's tournament structure ===
==== Masters 1000 ====
The [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] is a group of nine tournaments that form the second-highest echelon in men's tennis. Each event is held annually, and a win at one of these events is worth 1000 ranking points. When the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]], led by [[Hamilton Jordan]], began running the men's tour in 1990, the directors designated the top nine tournaments, outside of the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events, as &quot;Super 9&quot; events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/abouttheitf/worldwide/history.asp|title=History of Tennis|accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 this became the Tennis Masters Series and in 2004 the [[ATP Masters Series]]. In November at the end of the tennis year, the world's top eight players compete in the [[ATP World Tour Finals]], a tournament with a rotating locale. It is currently held in [[London, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6264650.stm | title = London to host World Tour Final | publisher = [[BBC Sport]], Piers Newbery | date = 3 July 2007 | accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007 the ATP announced major changes to the tour that were introduced in 2009. The Masters Series was renamed to the &quot;Masters 1000&quot;, the addition of the number 1000 referring to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of each tournament. Contrary to earlier plans, the number of tournaments was not reduced from nine to eight and the [[Monte Carlo Masters]] remains part of the series although, unlike the other events, it does not have a mandatory player commitment. The [[Hamburg Masters]] has been downgraded to a 500-point event. The [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid Masters]] moved to May and onto clay courts, and a new tournament in [[Shanghai]] took over Madrid's former indoor October slot. As of 2011 six of the nine &quot;1000&quot; level tournaments are combined ATP and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coretennis.net/majic/pageServer/0p0100006b/en/ATP-Tour-2009.html |title=ATP Tour 2009 |publisher=Coretennis.net |date= |accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and fourth tier of men's tennis tournaments are formed by the [[ATP World Tour 500 series]], consisting of 11 tournaments, and the [[ATP World Tour 250 series]] with 40 tournaments.&lt;ref name=season&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP World Tour Season|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tournaments/Tournament-Landing.aspx|publisher=ATP|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]], these events offer various amounts of prize money and the numbers refer to the amount of ranking points earned by the winner of a tournament.&lt;ref name=Rankings/&gt; The [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] offer the largest financial incentive to players, with total prize money of [[US$]]2,313,975 (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Tournaments/Dubai.aspx|publisher=ATP|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These series have various draws of 28, 32, 48 and 56 for singles and 16 and 24 for doubles. It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open.

==== Challenger Tour and Futures tournaments ====
The [[ATP Challenger Tour|Challenger Tour]] for men is the lowest level of tournament administered by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]]. It is composed of about 150 events and, as a result, features a more diverse range of countries hosting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tournaments/Challenger/ABOUT.aspx | title = About the Challenger Circuit | publisher = [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] | accessdate = 2 May 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100227095535/http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tournaments/Challenger/ABOUT.aspx | archivedate = 27 February 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of players use the Challenger Series at the beginning of their career to work their way up the rankings. [[Andre Agassi]], between winning Grand Slam tournaments, plummeted to World No. 141 and used Challenger Series events for match experience and to progress back up the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon06/news/story?id=2506393 | title = An appreciation of Andre Agassi | publisher = [[ESPN]], Matt Wilansky | date = 1 July 2006 | accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Challenger Series offers prize funds of between [[US$]]25,000 and US$150,000.

Below the Challenger Tour are the Futures tournaments, events on the [[ITF Men's Circuit]]. These tournaments also contribute towards a player's [[ATP rankings]] points. Futures Tournaments offer prize funds of between US$10,000 and US$15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/mens/circuitinfo/index.asp|title=About the ITF Men's Circuit|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 530 Futures Tournaments are played each year.

=== Women's tournament structure ===
==== Premier events ====
[[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier]] events for women form the most prestigious level of events on the [[WTA Tour|Women's Tennis Association Tour]] after the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. These events offer the largest rewards in terms of points and prize money. Within the Premier category are Premier Mandatory, Premier 5, and Premier tournaments. The Premier events were introduced in 2009 replacing the previous Tier I and II tournament categories. Currently four tournaments are Premier Mandatory, five tournaments are Premier 5, and twelve tournaments are Premier. The first tiering system in women's tennis was introduced in 1988. At the time of its creation, only two tournaments, the [[Lipton International Players Championships]] in [[Florida]] and the [[WTA German Open|German Open]] in Berlin, comprised the [[Tier I]] category.

==== International events ====
[[WTA International tournaments|International tournaments]] are the second main tier of the WTA tour and consist of 31 tournaments, with a prize money for every event at U.S.$220,000, except for the year-ending [[Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions]] in [[Bali]], which has prize money of U.S.$600,000.

== Players ==
=== Professional players ===
Professional tennis players enjoy the same relative perks as most top sports personalities: clothing, equipment and endorsements. Like players of other individual sports such as golf, they are not salaried, but must play and finish highly in tournaments to obtain prize money.

In recent years, some controversy has surrounded the involuntary or deliberate noise caused by players' [[Grunting (tennis)|grunting]].

====Singles and doubles professional careers====
While players are gradually less competitive in singles by their late 20s and early 30s, they can still continue competitively in doubles (as instanced by [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[John McEnroe]], who won doubles titles in their 40s).

In the Open Era, several female players such as [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Margaret Court]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Serena Williams]], and [[Venus Williams]] (the latter two sisters playing together) have been prolific at both singles and doubles events throughout their careers. [[John McEnroe]] is one of the very few professional male players to be top ranked in both singles and doubles at the same time,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt20000130&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.julianrubinstein.com/john.html |first=Julian |last=Rubinstein |title=Being John McEnroe |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 30, 2000 |accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/john-mcenroe |title=John McEnroe |website=[[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=October 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220802/http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/john-mcenroe |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6M0AEe3xA0C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=mcenroe+%22greatest+doubles%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4AjDPjAb5G&amp;sig=8NctZ15zDcc6PxzL9VmNJiD1E44&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EJRuUrvYM6f8iQKOmIH4Cg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mcenroe%20%22greatest%20doubles%22&amp;f=false |last=Cronin |first=Matthew |title=Epic: John McEnroe, Bjorn Borg, and the Greatest Tennis Season Ever |date=10 March 2011 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-01595-7 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] is the most recent male player to win multiple Grand Slams in both singles and doubles during the same period of his career.

In terms of public attention and earnings (see below), singles champions have far surpassed their doubles counterparts. The Open Era, particularly the men's side, has seen many top-ranked singles players that only sparingly compete in doubles, while having &quot;doubles specialists&quot; who are typically being eliminated early in the singles draw but do well in the doubles portion of a tournament. Notable doubles pairings include [[The Woodies]] ([[Todd Woodbridge]] and [[Mark Woodforde]]) and the [[Bryan Brothers]] (identical twin brothers [[Bob Bryan|Robert Charles &quot;Bob&quot; Bryan]] and [[Mike Bryan|Michael Carl &quot;Mike&quot; Bryan]]). Woodbridge has disliked the term &quot;doubles ‘specialists’&quot;, saying that he and Woodforde &quot;set a singles schedule and doubles fitted in around that&quot;, although later in Woodbridge's career he focused exclusively on doubles as his singles ranking fell too low that it was no longer financially viable to recover at that age. Woodbridge noted that while top singles players earn enough that they don't need to nor want to play doubles, he suggested that lower-ranked singles players outside the Top Ten should play doubles to earn more playing time and money.&lt;ref name=&quot;tennis.com&quot;&gt;http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/04/doubles-specialists-face-unusual-pressure-atmosphere-in-olympic-tennis/58267/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tennismash.com&quot;&gt;https://tennismash.com/2017/03/14/woodbridge-doubles-specialists-tennis-players/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Olympics====
The Olympics doubles tennis tournament necessitates that both members of a doubles pairing be from the same country, hence several top professional pairs such as [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Bruno Soares]] cannot compete in the Olympics. Top-ranked singles players that are usually rivals on the professional circuit, such as [[Boris Becker]] and [[Michael Stich]], and [[Roger Federer]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]] have formed a rare doubles partnership for the Olympics. Unlike professional tennis tournaments (see below) where singles players receive much more prize money than doubles players, an Olympic medal for both singles and doubles has similar prestige. The Olympics is more of a priority for doubles champions while singles champions often skip the tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;tennis.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tennismash.com&quot;/&gt; While the ATP has voted for Olympic results to count towards player ranking points, WTA players voted against it.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/06/sports/sp-65453&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2000 Olympics]], [[Lisa Raymond]] was passed over for Team USA in favor of [[Serena Williams]] by captain [[Billie Jean King]], even though Raymond was the top-ranked doubles player in the world at the time, and Raymond unsuccessfully challenged the selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nytimes.com%2F2000%2F08%2F24%2Fsports%2Ftennis-raymond-bid-turned-down-by-arbitrator.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jevjq7TVR7REmArJOwgao&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prize money====
In professional tennis tournaments such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the singles competition receives the most prize money and coverage, followed by doubles, and then mixed doubles usually receive the lowest monetary awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wimbledon Prize Money|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/news?slug=ap-wimbledonprizemoneylist|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in the [[US Open (tennis)#Prize money|US Open]] as of 2018, the men's and women's singles prize money (US$40,912,000) accounts for 80.9 percent of total player base compensation, while men's and women's doubles (US$6,140,840), men's and women's singles qualifying (US$3,008,000), and mixed doubles (US$505,000) account for 12.1 percent, 5.9 percent, and 1.0 percent, respectively. The singles winner receives US$3,800,000, while the doubles winning pair receives $700,000 and the mixed doubles winning pair receives US$155,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prize money&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/visit/prize_money.html | title=2018 US Open Prize Money | publisher=[[United States Tennis Association]] | accessdate=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greatest male players ===
{{further|Tennis male players statistics|World number one male tennis player rankings}}

A frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an [[Associated Press]] poll in 1950 named [[Bill Tilden]] as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016509.html|title=Tilden brought theatrics to tennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] three times and the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]] seven times. In 1938, however, [[Donald Budge]] became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]], and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge &quot;the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1930s/sports/1937_Don_Budge_on_Davis_Cup_SF_Win_Over_Von_Cramm.html | title=Don Budge's Comments After 1937 Davis Cup Semi-final Match Against Baron Gottfried von Cramm (1:07) | accessdate=29 May 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426051252/http://www.authentichistory.com/1930s/sports/1937_Don_Budge_on_Davis_Cup_SF_Win_Over_Von_Cramm.html | archivedate=26 April 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer]] said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis''|date=|year=1979|last1=Kramer|first1=Jack|last2=Deford|first2=Frank|isbn=0-399-12336-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[Tony Trabert]] has said that of the players he saw before the start of the [[Open Era|open era]], Kramer was the best male champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsmediainc.net/tennisweek/index.cfm?func=showarticle&amp;newsid=10503&amp;bannerregion | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024737/http://www.sportsmediainc.net/tennisweek/index.cfm?func=showarticle&amp;newsid=10503&amp;bannerregion | archivedate=27 September 2007 | title=The Tennis Week Interview: Tony Trabert Part II | author=Richard Pagliaro | date=26 February 2004 | accessdate=29 May 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bill Tilden in color.jpg|upright|thumb|Bill Tilden]]
By the 1960s, Budge and others had added [[Pancho Gonzales]] and [[Lew Hoad]] to the list of contenders. Budge reportedly believed that Gonzales was the greatest player ever.&lt;ref&gt;Will Grimsley, ''Tennis: Its History, People, and Events'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales said about Hoad, &quot;When Lew's game was at its peak nobody could touch him.&amp;nbsp;... I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesbuddell.com/files/hoad.pdf|title=Hoad|publisher=Jame Buddell|accessdate=28 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625042034/http://www.jamesbuddell.com/files/hoad.pdf|archive-date=25 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during the open era, [[Rod Laver]] remains the only male player in history to have won the calendar year Grand Slam twice in 1962 and 1969 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sclink |first1=Leo |title=Rod Laver's priceless Grand Slam |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/rod-lavers-priceless-grand-slam/story-fn794248-1226248836465 |work=Herald Sun |location=Australia |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the calendar year Professional Grand Slam in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bercow |first1=John |title=Tennis Maestros: The Twenty Greatest Male Tennis Players of All Time |date=2014 |publisher=Biteback Publishing |location=London, England |isbn=978-1-84954-765-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTSzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;dq=The+French+pro+tennis+championships+men%27s+event+only&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi27sun44jYAhULN48KHat2BYIQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20French%20pro%20tennis%20championships%20men's%20event%20only&amp;f=false |language=en |chapter=Chapter 9: Rod Laver}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Björn Borg]] and [[Pete Sampras]] were regarded by many of their contemporaries as among the greatest ever. [[Andre Agassi]], the first of two male players in history to have achieved a [[Career Golden Slam]] in singles tennis (followed by [[Rafael Nadal]]), has been called the best service returner in the history of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;cba&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/tennis/simon-reed/article/1176/ &quot;Reed's shotmakers: Men's return of serve&quot;].

More recently, [[Roger Federer]] is considered by many observers to have the most &quot;complete&quot; game in modern tennis. He has won 20 grand slam titles and 6 World Tour Finals, the most for any male player. Many experts of tennis, former tennis players and his own tennis peers believe Federer is the greatest player in the history of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Roddick: Federer might be greatest ever | date=3 July 2005 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/wimb/2005-07-03-roddick-marvels_x.htm | agency =Associated Press | pages = | accessdate =2 March 2007 | language = | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federer inspires comparisons to all-time greats |date=12 September 2004 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/tennis/specials/us_open/2004/09/12/bc.ten.stevewilstein.ap/index.html |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2 March 2007 |work=CNN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313102231/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/tennis/specials/us_open/2004/09/12/bc.ten.stevewilstein.ap/index.html |archivedate=13 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=4-In-A-Row For Federer | date=9 July 2006 | publisher= | url =http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/09/sportsline/main1786534.shtml | agency =Associated Press | pages = | accessdate =2 March 2007 | language = | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Pritha | last=Sarkar | title=Greatness beckons Federer | date=4 July 2005 | publisher= | url =http://www.rediff.com/sports/2005/jul/04wimb1.htm | work =Reuters | pages = | accessdate =2 March 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Bud | last=Collins | title=Federer Simply In a League of His Own | date=3 July 2005 | publisher=MSNBC.COM | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8455431/ | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20050706021750/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8455431/ | url-status =dead | archive-date =6 July 2005 | work = MSNBC Website | pages = | accessdate =9 April 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8133424.stm?|title=BBC&amp;nbsp;– Federer Breaks Sampras Record | date=5 July 2009 | accessdate=6 January 2010 | work=BBC News | first=Piers | last=Newbery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer's biggest rival [[Rafael Nadal]] is regarded as the greatest competitor in tennis history by some former players and is regarded to have the potential to be the greatest of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtennismagazine.com/archives/3348 |title=Federer or Nadal?

As with the men there are frequent discussions about who is the greatest female singles player of all time with [[Steffi Graf]], [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Serena Williams]] being the three players most often nominated.

In March 2012 the TennisChannel published a combined list of the 100 greatest men and women tennis players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest of All Time|url=http://www.tennischannel.com/goat/71.aspx|publisher=The Tennis Channel|accessdate=3 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605022801/http://www.tennischannel.com/goat/71.aspx|archivedate=5 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ranked Steffi Graf as the greatest female player (in 3rd place overall), followed by [[Martina Navratilova]] (4th place) and [[Margaret Court]] (8th place). The rankings were determined by an international panel.
