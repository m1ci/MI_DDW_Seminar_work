'''Park Jae-sang''' ({{korean|hangul=박재상|hanja=朴載相}}, {{IPA-ko|pɐk̚.t͡ɕεsɐŋ|IPA}}; born December 31, 1977), known professionally as '''Psy''' ({{korean|싸이|labels=no}}; {{IPAc-en|s|aɪ}} {{respell|SY}}; {{IPA-ko|s͈ai|lang}}), stylized in [[all caps]], is a South Korean singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Psy is known domestically for his humorous videos and stage performances, and internationally for his hit single &quot;[[Gangnam Style]]&quot;. The song's refrain was entered into ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' as one of the most famous quotations of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Top Quotes: From 'Binders Full of Women' to 'Gangnam Style'|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/2012-Top-Quotes-From-Binders-Full-of-Women-to-Gangnam-Style-182734061.html|publisher=NBC Miami (Associated Press)|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2012, Psy met United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]] where Ban expressed his desire to work with the singer because of his &quot;unlimited global reach&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Lizzy|title=Rapper Psy brings Gangnam Style horseplay to United Nations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/psy-gangnam-style-united-nations|work=The Guardian|accessdate=October 24, 2012|location=London|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2012, his music video for &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; exceeded one billion views on [[YouTube]], becoming the first video to do so in the website's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/12/21/psy-gangnam-style-billion-views-youtube/ | title = PSY Gangnam Style Billion Views Youtube | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57560498-93/gangnam-style-becomes-first-video-to-hit-1-billion-youtube-views/ | title = 'Gangnam Style' becomes first video to hit 1 billion | publisher = CNET | date = December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psy was subsequently recognized by the media as the &quot;King of YouTube&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psy now king of YouTube|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/psy-becomes-youtube-no1/story-fnejlvvj-1226523695116|publisher=News.com.au|accessdate=December 2, 2012|date=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ariosto|first=David|title=Move over Bieber – Gangnam is new YouTube king|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/24/showbiz/gangnam-style/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 2, 2012|date=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Move over Bieber, PSY's the new king of YouTube|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/move-over-bieber-psy-s-the-new-king-of-youtube-1.1052882|publisher=CTV Television Network|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2014, the video for Psy's Gangnam Style hit two billion views. {{asof|2019|December}}, it is the seventh most viewed video on YouTube, with over 3.4 billion views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PSY - GANGNAM STYLE(강남스타일) M/V|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0|website=Youtube|publisher=Psy|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1977–1995: Early life===

Park attended Banpo (반포) Elementary and Middle Schools and Sehwa (세화) High School.&lt;ref name=&quot;naver&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.search.naver.com/search.naver?sm=tab_txc&amp;where=people_profile&amp;ie=utf8&amp;query=싸이&amp;os=158367|title=Psy Profile|publisher=naver|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked school and was known as the [[:wiktionary:class clown|class clown]]. In an interview on South Korea's [[Seoul Broadcasting System]], a former teacher of Park said: &quot;I remember Psy making a lot of [[Off-color humor|sexual jokes]] during class. He had such a big influence that he would drive the entire class to his jokes. I disliked him at the time, but looking back, I see that he added a great energy to the class.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PSY's Yearbook Photo and Mischievous Childhood Revealed!|url=http://www.soompi.com/2012/10/12/psys-yearbook-photo-and-mischievous-childhood-revealed/|publisher=Soompi|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park told CNN's [[Alina Cho]] that when he was 15 years old, he watched a Korean TV programme that introduced foreign pop music. One particular episode showed a concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] held by the British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] where they performed their 1975 hit single &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;. Park said it was this concert footage that sparked his love for music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psy: Growing up 'Gangnam Style'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2012/11/23/exp-talk-asia-psy-growing-gangnam.cnn|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–2000: Brief study in the United States and career beginnings===
As part of preparations to take over DI Corporation from his father, Park had originally planned to study [[business administration]] at [[Boston University]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psy vows topless show if 'Gangnam Style' hits No. 1|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-25/news/34086640_1_psy-fame-dance|work=Daily News |location=New York|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon his arrival in the [[United States]], he lost interest in his studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tack-Whan|first=Wi|title=PSY, the man behind the name|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=102999|publisher=Korea.net|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending his remaining tuition funds on musical instruments and entertainment equipment, including a computer, an electric keyboard, and a [[MIDI]] interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Marlow|title=Psy Talks Gangnam Style, Growing Up, and His Next Single|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/10/28/psy-talks-gangnam-style-growing-up-and-his-next-single.html|work=Daily Beast|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending an English-language summer course and studying for one semester, Park dropped out of Boston University and applied to study at [[Berklee College of Music]] instead. During his time at Berklee, Park took core curriculum lessons in ear training, contemporary writing and music synthesis, but he soon dropped out and returned to South Korea to pursue a career as a singer, without having attained a degree from either Boston University or Berklee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did You Know This About Psy?|url=http://www.ellentv.com/2012/09/19/did-you-know-this-about-psy/|publisher=Ellen TV|accessdate=October 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DczWUv30?url=http://www.ellentv.com/2012/09/19/did-you-know-this-about-psy/|archivedate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocheleau|first=Matt|title=BU hopes to get donation from former student Psy, the South Korean rapper known for 'Gangnam Style' hit|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/allston_brighton/2012/10/bu_hopes_to_get_donation_from.html|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brighton|first=Allston|title=BU hopes to get donation from former student Psy, the South Korean rapper known for 'Gangnam Style' hit|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/allston_brighton/2012/10/bu_hopes_to_get_donation_from.html?camp|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=October 28, 2012|date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, Psy made his first appearance on Korean national television in 2000 after his dancing caught the eye of a TV producer.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Emma|title=Gangnam Style a hit with Oxford students|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/10033043.Gangnam_Style_a_hit_with_Oxford_students/|work=The Oxford Times|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001–02: ''Psy from the Psycho World!'', controversy, and domestic success===
In January 2001, Psy debuted his full-length album ''[[Psy from the Psycho World!]]'', for which he was fined by South Korean government authorities due to his album's &quot;inappropriate content&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carbone|first=Nick|title=Gangnam Rile: Psy's Past Anti-American Performances Stir Controversy|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/08/gangnam-rile-psys-past-anti-american-performances-stir-controversy/|work=Time|accessdate=December 19, 2012|date=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psy was a rookie [[hip hop]] singer that stirred up the Korean pop music scene with very blunt lyrics, peculiar dance moves and an unconventional appearance that earned him the nickname &quot;The Bizarre Singer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_artist_detail.htm?No=10071|title=KBS WORLD - Psy Biography|publisher=[[KBS World Radio]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garibaldi|first=Christina|title=Britney Spears Learns Psy's 'Gangnam Style' On Ellen Britney's wish is Ellen DeGeneres' command, as 'X Factor' judge meets Psy after tweeting about his dance.|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1693607/britney-spears-psy-gangnam-style.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlan|first=Maggie|title=PSY: 5 Things to Know About the 'Gangnam Style' Rapper|url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20302940_20627446,00.html|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second album ''Sa 2'' also created controversy upon its release in 2002, earning complaints from civil groups due to the potentially negative influence his album would have on children and teenagers. Since then, Psy has been thought of as a controversial artist, and ''Sa 2'' was banned in 2002 from being sold to the under-19 set. In September of the same year, Psy released his third album ''3 Psy''. The album's title song, &quot;Champion&quot;, saw great success partly due to the hype from the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] games held in Seoul. Despite the significant amount of controversy surrounding his music, Psy was awarded songwriting accolades at the annual [[Seoul Music Awards]], marking his breakthrough in the South Korean music industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Psy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=About Psy|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/psy/biography/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003–09: Military service, ''Ssajib'', and re-enlistment===
In 2003, Psy was conscripted into the [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean military]] as part of [[Conscription in South Korea|mandatory military service]] imposed on all South Korean men aged 18 to 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hewitt|first=Giles|title=Psy brings 'Gangnam Style' home with free show|url=http://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/psy-thank-fans-free-gangnam-style-concert-044608559.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist search: Psy|url=http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_artist_detail.htm?No=10071|publisher=KBS|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psy was excused from military duty due to working at a software development company (the [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]] grants exemptions to those with technical expertise work in companies that serve the national interest). He was expected to be released from duties in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Psy May Be Enlisted for Military Service Again|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/117_4583.html|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=October 27, 2012|date=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Psy released his fourth album ''[[Ssajib]]'', which won honors at the 2006 SBS Music Awards and Hong Kong's [[Mnet Asian Music Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About Psy&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, state prosecutors accused Psy of &quot;neglecting&quot; his work, holding concerts and appearing on local television networks during his period of prior employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psy Called Up for Military Again|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/117_15438.html|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=October 27, 2012|date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, 2007, the Seoul Administrative Court decided that Psy must be redrafted, rejecting a lawsuit filed by Psy against the Military Manpower Administration (MMA) in August. Two months later, Psy was re-drafted into the military where he had held the rank of [[Private First Class]] and served as a [[signalman]] in the [[Republic of Korea Army|52nd Army Infantry Division]], before being released from duties in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AFP|title=Singer Psy during his 2008 stint in the military|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVKTm7MdtfE|publisher=YouTube (AFP)|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Si-soo|title=Singer Psy to Be Redrafted|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/117_15438.html|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
In a 2012 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Psy called [[Freddie Mercury]] of the British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] his biggest musical influence: &quot;My lifetime role model and hero is Freddie Mercury of Queen. His songwriting skills, I cannot even approach, but his showmanship, I learned it from videos.

Psy is known for his sense of humor in his concerts, where he imitates female singers such as [[Park Ji-yoon]], [[Lee Hyo-ri]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psy danced to Gaga, Beyonce before 'Gangnam Style'|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/09/28/12/psy-danced-gaga-beyonce-gangnam-style|publisher=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although his music is part of the [[K-pop]] (Korean popular music) genre, Beth Hong from ''[[The Vancouver Observer]]'' noted that Psy doesn't fit the standard [[K-pop idol]] image of being &quot;incredibly young, good-looking, and able to carry a melodramatic note&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hong|first=Beth|title=Bizarre 'Gangnam Style' K-pop music video blows up worldwide|url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/thescene/bizarre-gangnam-style-k-pop-music-video-blows-worldwide|work=Vancouver Observer|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on North Korea===
In the early 2010s, South Korea's [[Sunshine Policy]] towards North Korea was abolished as tensions between the two countries continued to increase. As a result, Psy was questioned by the media on several occasions regarding his views on North Korea.

On April 13, 2013, Psy attended a press conference where he expressed regret about his country's conflict with North Korea and described the situation as a &quot;tragedy&quot;. He also expressed hope that North Koreans would one day be able to enjoy his music before elaborating that his job is to make everyone, including North Koreans, laugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PSY says he hopes NKoreans enjoy his new single|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/psy-says-he-hopes-nkoreans-enjoy-his-new-single|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=April 30, 2013|quote=&quot;It's a tragedy. We are the only countries divided right now,&quot; PSY said at a news conference ahead of the concert. North and South Korea, which are divided by heavily fortified borders, are technically still at war, with the 1950-53 Korean War ending with a cease-fire, not a peace treaty. PSY said he hoped North Koreans would enjoy his new music. He said his job was to make all people, including North Koreans, laugh.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right before the start of a concert in [[Seoul]], Psy added: &quot;Tonight me and 50,000 Korean people... we are going to sing out loud. We are going to shout out loud and we are really close to them, so they [the [[North Korea]]ns] can hear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Psy Unveils Sequel To Gangnam Style Hit | work = Sky News | date = April 13, 2013 | accessdate = February 18, 2016 | url = http://news.sky.com/story/1077672/psy-unveils-sequel-to-gangnam-style-hit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' (an American news website), Psy was asked to give his take on [[Kim Jong-un]]'s recent threats against South Korea and the United States, to which he replied: &quot;Well, as an entertainer, I don't want to talk about politics. As a Korean citizen, I want peace. That's all I can say. I want permanent peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marlow|first=Stern|title=Psy on New Single 'Gentleman,' Kim Jong-un, Justin Bieber &amp; More|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/29/psy-on-new-single-gentleman-kim-jong-un-justin-bieber-more.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
===Anti-American performances and subsequent apology===
[[File:Psy from acrofan.jpg|thumb|Psy in March 2012, during a press conference for a Korean television show ''[[Superstar K4]]''.]]
In 2002, Psy participated in an [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] concert after a [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] convoy accidentally struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls in the [[Yangju highway incident]]. The soldiers involved in the incident were acquitted by U.S. military courts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirk|first=Don|title=2d GI acquitted in deaths of 2 South Korean girls|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/25/news/25iht-A_24.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 7, 2012|date=November 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fueled a significant amount of [[Anti-American sentiment in Korea|anti-American sentiment in South Korea]]. Inspired by that incident, Psy lifted up a miniature model of an 'American tank' and smashed it against the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirell|first=Andrew|title='Gangnam Style' Singer PSY's Vitriolic Anti-American Past Revealed, Outrage Ensues|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/gangnam-style-singer-psys-vitriolic-anti-american-past-revealed-outrage-ensues/|newspaper=Mediate|date=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the South Korean translator and Christian missionary [[Kim Sun-il]] was kidnapped and beheaded in Iraq after the South Korean government refused to reconsider sending its armed forces to support the [[Iraq War]]. Although initial protests were only directed towards the South Korean government and towards extremists in Iraq, anti-U.S. military protesters decided to seize the moment to trigger a much larger wave of anti-Americanism. During a concert, Psy admonished the Iraqi kidnappers, condemned South Korea's former president [[Roh Moo-hyun]], and also sang along to lyrics of the song &quot;Dear American&quot; by South Korean rock band [[N.EX.T]], which criticizes the United States military for its actions in the Iraq war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Gangnam Nationalism: Why Psy's anti-American rap shouldn't surprise you|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/07/gangnam-nationalism-why-psys-anti-american-rap-shouldnt-surprise-you/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial translation of the lyrics was posted by an iReporter onto CNN's [[iReport]] site.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Imam|first=Jareen|title=PSY apologizes for viral anti-American lyrics|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/07/showbiz/psy-apology-irpt/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 8, 2012|date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the lyrics, referring to the guards who tortured Iraqi prisoners, were inaccurately translated by CNN as follows: &quot;Kill those fucking Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives and those who ordered them to torture&quot; and &quot;Kill [the Yankees'] daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers / Kill them all slowly and painfully.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama to attend PSY performance despite protests|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/obama-attend-psy-performance-despite-protests|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that the actual Korean lyrics did not include the word &quot;Yankee&quot; or any other [[pejorative]] referring specifically to Americans.

A few days later ''[[The Washington Post]]'' raised questions about the accuracy of the translation of the lyrics into English, which originated from [[CNN]]'s citizen journalism initiative iReport. Max Fisher of ''The Washington Post'' foreign staff reported that he solicited native Korean and English speakers, academics accustomed to the sensitivity of word-for-word translations, young Koreans familiar with the cultural connotations of the lyrics, and a professional interpreter to offer their translation of the lyrics, and found out that the lyrics may have actually slurred the American servicemen rather than calling for their deaths, although he did also go on to opine that, &quot;using a [[racial slur]] to accuse Americans of killing Iraqis' family members is still pretty serious&quot;.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newser.com/story/159158/translators-psy-didnt-really-say-kill-those-yankees.html|title=Translators: Psy Didn't Really Say 'Kill Those Yankees' - Bad translation fuels controversy|last=Spak|first=Kevin|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Newser]]|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher also states that the word translated 'Yankee' in the CNN iReport was underplayed, with one Korean American describing the slur as a &quot;nearly untranslatable&quot; racist “epithet,” perhaps best approximated as “foreign barbarian.” Fisher notes that one translator indicates that the slur is meant as &quot;a derogatory term for American&quot;, and that others have translated the slur alternately as &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;big nose&quot;, and &quot;despicable Western women and men&quot;.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Controversy over Psy's anti-American lyrics might be based on shoddy translation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/11/controversy-over-psys-anti-american-lyrics-might-be-based-on-shoddy-translation/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Psy's actions did not receive any significant international media coverage at that time, this changed after the media reported about it in early December 2012. On December 7, 2012, Psy issued an apology directed towards members of the U.S. military and to the American people for his &quot;inflammatory and inappropriate&quot; language, and expressed hope that the American public would accept his apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Psy Apologizes For 'Inflammatory And Inappropriate' Anti-American Lyrics|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1698546/psy-apology-anti-american-lyrics.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial public outrage, [[White House]] spokesman [[Josh Earnest]] told the media that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] will attend Psy's performance at the ''[[Christmas in Washington]]'' charity concert as planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carbone&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Carbone|first=Nick|title=Gangnam Rile: Psy's Past Anti-American Performances Stir Controversy|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/08/gangnam-rile-psys-past-anti-american-performances-stir-controversy/|work=Time|accessdate=December 8, 2012|date=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the controversy, a petition circulated on the website of the White House demanding that he be dropped from the concert, although the petition was deleted later in the day because the White House website claimed that the petition violated the website's terms of participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot; /&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Nick Carbone asserted that it is &quot;unlikely that these newly dug-up anecdotes will depose Psy from his king-like level of stardom&quot; although Carbone did go on to write that the atmosphere at the White House concert would be &quot;somewhat subdued&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carbone&quot;/&gt;

===Malaysian political rally===
Psy was invited to perform on February 11, 2013 in [[Penang, Malaysia]] for the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] party in an attempt to reach out to young voters in the area. Media reports estimated a cost of at least US$300,000 for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=K-pop star Psy caught up in political fight in Penang|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/aec/K-pop-star-Psy-caught-up-in-political-fight-in-Pen-30199575.html|accessdate=February 11, 2013|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition backers called for supporters of the [[Democratic Action Party]] to attend wearing opposition colors. Despite the controversy and calls by Malaysian citizens to cancel the concert,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysians call on Psy to cancel concert|url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201302052150-0022525|accessdate=February 11, 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psy completed a [[Chinese New Year]] open house performance at Han Chiang School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shankar|first=Ahti|title=Thousands throng 'Psy' open house|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/02/11/thousands-throng-%E2%80%98psy%E2%80%99-open-house/|accessdate=February 11, 2013|newspaper=Free Malaysia Today|date=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212070433/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/02/11/thousands-throng-%E2%80%98psy%E2%80%99-open-house/|archive-date=February 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a crowd of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mok|first=Opalyn|title=Psy wows crowd at Penang BN Chinese New Year party|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/psy-wows-crowd-at-penang-bn-chinese-new-year-party|accessdate=February 11, 2013|newspaper=The Malaysian Insider|date=February 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213094845/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/psy-wows-crowd-at-penang-bn-chinese-new-year-party|archivedate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the concert, a media report revealed that Psy received death threats prior to entering the country and this was the reason for the delay in Psy's on-stage appearance. Psy eventually performed for ten minutes to an excited crowd. The media report also reported on a press conference at the Jelutong Gerakan Chinese New Year open house that revealed that questions were raised over the financing of the event. State [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) party chief Teng Chang Yeow explained that the event &quot;was sponsored by private sponsors who preferred to remain anonymous as they are afraid of being 'victimised' if their identities were revealed&quot;. Teng also stated that he was given the choice of a [[Justin Bieber]] visit, but chose Psy as he didn't know who Bieber was at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teng says attempt on Psy's life forced Najib to leave stage|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/teng-says-attempt-on-psys-life-forced-najib-to-leave-stage/|accessdate=December 7, 2013|newspaper=The Malaysian Insider|date=February 14, 2013|author=Opalyn Mok|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005446/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/teng-says-attempt-on-psys-life-forced-najib-to-leave-stage/|archivedate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questionable song title and revision of lyrics===
In March 2013, South Korean media reported that the title of Psy's upcoming single would contain the word &quot;Assarabia&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Su-Jin|first=Kang|title=Ready with a Song to Follow 'Gangnam Style'|url=http://english.khan.co.kr/khan_art_view.html?artid=201303181825097&amp;code=960802|publisher=[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a slang used by South Koreans to express thrills, or simply to describe something satisfying. There were numerous objections to that upcoming title, and worries have risen that people of Arabic descent might misinterpret the title and find it derogatory.&lt;ref name=&quot;apassarabia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=PSY to revise song over worry it may offend Arabs|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/psy-revise-song-over-worry-it-may-offend-arabs|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being questioned by a correspondent of the [[Voice of America]] about the upcoming track's potential to offend, Psy voiced out that there has been some misunderstanding and his upcoming song will undergo a major revamp.&lt;ref name=&quot;voa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Steve|title='Gangnam Style' Artist Says Title of Next Single Will Not Offend|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/south-korean-artist-psy-tells-voa-via-twitter-next-single-will-not-carry-offensive-title/1623536.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2013, he revised his song's title and lyrics over &quot;worries it could offend Arabs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;apassarabia&quot;/&gt; Many people consider the change of his song title deliberate, aimed solely at building publicity for a strong follow-up to &quot;[[Gangnam Style]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;voa&quot;/&gt; He subsequently renamed the song &quot;[[Gentleman (Psy song)|Gentleman]]&quot; and released it on April 12, 2013.

==Reported earnings==
According to ''[[Korea Times]]'' in 2013, Psy earned more than US$40 million in 2012 via sales through concerts, TV commercials, and social media revenue through his hit song ''Gangnam Style'', while his estimated personal income in 2012 was US$28 million under his 7:3 profit-sharing contract with YG Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/04/386_133416.html | title=Who are celebs with big income? | publisher=Korea Times | date=April 5, 2013 | accessdate=January 23, 2015 | author=Park Si-soo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
