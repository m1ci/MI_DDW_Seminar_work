A '''triathlon''' is a [[multisport race]] with three continuous and sequential endurance [[racing|race]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|first1=William E.|last2=Kirkendall|first2=Donald T. |title=Exercise and sport science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;pg=PA919&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-683-03421-9|page=919}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, from τρεῖς or ''treis'' (three) and ἆθλος or ''athlos'' (competition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.yudu.com/A1q893/USATWinter2011/resources/111.htm|title=Tiredathlon|last=Matlow|first=Jeff|publisher=USA Triathlon Life|page=101|date=Winter 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Triathlon#Nonstandard variations|variations]] of the sport exist, the most common form includes [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[cycling]], and [[running]] over various distances. Triathletes compete for fastest overall course completion, including timed transitions between the three races.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett&quot;/&gt;

A transition area is set up where the athletes change gear for different segments of the race. This is where the switches from swimming to cycling and cycling to running occur. These areas are used to store bicycles, performance apparel, and any other accessories needed for the next stage of the race. The transition from swim to bike is referred to as T1 and that between the bike and run is referred to as T2. The athlete's overall time for the race includes time spent in T1 and T2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tri101&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mora|first=John|title=Triathlon 101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDllTxnGxH0C&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |edition=2 |year=2009 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-7944-0 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transition areas vary in size depending on the number of participants expected.

The nature of the sport focuses on persistent and often [[sports periodization|periodized]] training in each of the three disciplines, as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;TwelveWeek&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Tom|title=The 12-Week Triathlete: Train for a Triathlon in Just Three Months|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5LozmP4EAYC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Fair Winds|isbn=978-1-59233-126-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/12weektriathlete0000holl/page/123 123–129]|chapter=Chapter 9: Triathlon Training|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/12weektriathlete0000holl/page/123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:18-6-22 course des trois sports.jpg|thumb|1922 Course des trois sports]]
The evolution of triathlon as a distinct event is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author [[Scott Tinley]], consider events in early twentieth century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three element multisport events of differing composition appearing all called by different names.&lt;ref name=&quot;thiswas0922&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thiswastriathlon.org/twt1_009.htm|title=Tri Sports History Timeline (1902–2008)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331195401/http://www.thiswastriathlon.org/twt1_009.htm|archivedate=31 March 2010|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;espn32&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/sport?sport=tr|title=ESPN – Triathlon milestones|date=|publisher=Sports.espn.go.com|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in [[Joinville-le-Pont]], [[Val-de-Marne]] it called itself &quot;''Les trois sports''&quot; (The three sports) it was advertised as an event for &quot;The sportsmen of the time&quot; and consisted of a run bicycle and canoe segment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Triathlon : [technique, tactique, entraînement]|last=Yves.|first=Cordier|date=1991|publisher=Laffont|others=Malaurent, Max.|isbn=2221071557|location=Paris|oclc=53765579}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 19 June 1921 the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon with the canoe element being replaced with a swim, newspaper [[L'Auto|L’Auto]] stating the race consisted of a 3&amp;nbsp;km run, a 12&amp;nbsp;km bike ride and the crossing of the river [[Marne (river)|Marne]], all staged consecutively and without a break.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k623021k/f4.item.r=course%20des%20trois%20sport%22trois%20sports%22|title=La journée sportive d'aujourd'hui|last=|first=|date=19 June 1921|work=Le Petit Journal|access-date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.multisportaustria.at/files/doc/History/Triathlon_History.pdf|title=History of Triathlon|last=|first=|date=|website=multisportaustria.at|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1920s other bike, run, and swim events had appeared in different cities such as the &quot;''Course des Trois Sports” in'' [[Marseille]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=John|date=March 1993|title=The First Triathlon?|url=|journal=Triathlete Magazine|volume=March 1993|pages=42, 43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And &quot;La Course des Débrouillards&quot; in [[Poissy]][[Poissy|.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; These multisport events would continue to slowly spread and grow in popularity such by 1934 &quot;Les Trois Sports&quot; was being hosted in the city of [[La Rochelle]] though it consisted three distinct events, swimming a channel crossing (200m),a bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu(10&amp;nbsp;km), and a run in the stadium André-Barbeau(1.2&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mechikoff&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history and philosophy of sport and physical education: from ancient civilizations to the modern world|last=Mechikoff|first=Robert|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2009|isbn=9780073376493|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Throughout this growth with new events appearing no unified rules ever existed and as a whole would remain a minority event on the world stage. &amp;nbsp;

=== Modern beginnings ===

The first modern swim/bike/run event was held at [[Mission Bay, San Diego, California]] on September 25, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/san_diego_-_the_birthplace_of_triathlon|title=San Diego - the birthplace of triathlon|last=Union|first=International Triathlon|date=9 May 2012|website=Triathlon.org|language=en|access-date=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race was conceived and directed by two members of the San Diego Track Club, Jack Johnstone and Don Shanahan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ehritz|first=Kelly|url=https://beginnertriathlete.com/cms/article-detail.asp?articleid=251|title=History of the Triathlon|website=beginnertriathlete.com|language=en|access-date=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone recalls that he was a part of the [[Running boom of the 1970s|70s jogging craze in America]] and that after entering a few races he was not regaining his &quot;mediocre fitness&quot; despite having been a member of the 1957 Collegiate and [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] All-American swim teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triathlonhistory.com/|title=Story of the First Triathlon|website=triathlonhistory.com|access-date=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1973, Johnstone learned of the Dave Pain Birthday Biathlon,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Dave Pain was the founder of the Masters' running movement.&lt;/ref&gt; a 4.5 mile run followed by what was billed as a quarter-mile swim (the actual distance was between 200 and 300 yards). The following year after competing in the event for the second time and placing in the top ten Johnstone desired more of this style of race and with equal emphasis on the swim, so he petitioned the chairman of the San Diego Track Club who told him he would add a race to the club calendar but the rest of the race was up to Johnstone to organise and at the same time to contact Don Shanahan so there wouldn't be too many &quot;weird&quot; races on the club schedule. Shanahan told Johnstone that he wanted to include a biking leg to the race, whilst hesitant Johnstone agreed to the addition. When naming the event the pair used the unofficially agreed naming system for multisport event (already used for [[Modern pentathlon|pentathlon]], [[heptathlon]], and [[decathlon]]), of using the prefix [[Greek language|Greek]] number for the number of events ''trias'' (three) and suffix of ''athlos'' the Greek for a competition, hence named the event the Mission Bay Triathlon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/triathlon|title=triathlon {{!}} Origin and meaning of triathlon by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worthy of note that neither founder had heard of the French events, both believing their race a unique idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;History13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Triathlon' A Personal History by Scott Tinley|last=Tinley|first=Scott|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, September 25, 1974 the race started, it began with a run of a three-mile loop, then biking twice around [[Fiesta Island, Mission Bay|Fiesta Island]] for a total of five miles entrants would then get off the bikes, take their shoes off and run into the water swimming to the mainland, then ran in bare feet before swimming again along the bay, then did one last swim up to the entrance of Fiesta Island before crawling up a steep dirt bank to finish.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/dec/11/san-diegans-remember-first-triathlon-40-years-ago/|title=San Diegans Remember World's First Triathlon 40 Years Ago — At Mission Bay|last=Trageser|first=Claire|website=KPBS Public Media|language=en|access-date=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most participants were not skilled swimmers, so Johnstone recruited his 13-year-old son to float on his surfboard and act as lifeguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Also some participants took longer than expected, and it began to get dark as they finished their swims. Shanahan recalls they pulled up a few cars and turned on the headlights so the athletes could see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lostswimming.com/2012/04/10/the-first-triathlon-ever/|title=The first Triathlon ever… {{!}} L.O.S.T.

=== European migration ===
With the sport's popularity growing in the US its spread outside the country seemed inevitable, by 1980 triathlon had made its way across the Atlantic to northern Europe with the first European triathlon held on 30 August 1980 in [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], Czechoslovakia. The Netherlands, Belgium and West Germany follow after, all hosting an event in 1981, but the media coverage of these events is almost non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=20 ans de passion! 20 ans de triathlon! : 1989-2009|last=Gasquet|first=Frank|date=2009|publisher=|others=Fédération française de triathlon.|isbn=978-2907590594|location=Marseille|pages=12|oclc=762998534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1982, the event organiser [[IMG (company)|IMG]], worked in partnership with the American channel CBS (direct competitor of ABC who held the exclusive rights to Hawaii), to create a new event that would take place in Europe. The initial aim was to establish a new premier competition, the European Triathlon, with the goal of being of the same size and prestige to directly compete with that of Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ligue-ca-triathlon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/30-ans-du-Triathlon-de-Nice_83-92.pdf|title=30 years of nice triathlon|date=19 October 2014|website=ligue-ca-triathlon.com|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ligue-ca-triathlon.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F11%2F30-ans-du-Triathlon-de-Nice_83-92.pdf|archive-date=22 October 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the event was to be hosted in [[Monaco]], but with the death of [[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace]] in September 1982 the previous agreements fell through; however, IMG refused to cancel the event so it was reorganised to be hosted in [[Nice]], France. The first [[Nice Triathlon]] was held on 20 November 1982 where fifty seven competitors took the start, for an ill-defined competition that consisted of 1,500 meters of swimming, 100 kilometres of cycling and a [[Marathon (race)|marathon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon|title=Histoire du triathlon:1982|website=ffrti.com|date=|access-date=19 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year the national television station [[France 2]] broadcast a program, ''Voyage au bout de la souffrance'' (''Journey to the End of Suffering'') which detailed the events of the Nice Triathlon. This program shocked many that watched and was the introduction of the sport to the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Some fans of traditional sports strongly criticised this new practice as seven of the entrants were hospitalised due to the swim, as the temperature of the Mediterranean was only 14&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Despite this criticism IMG's plan succeeded and throughout the 1980s. The Nice triathlon was, alongside Hawaii, one of the two important Long Distance races each year for both prize money and media attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The year 1985 saw the creation of the first international triathlon structure, the European Triathlon Union (ETU) with the objectives to federate the triathlon structures in each European country and to act as a counterbalance to American triathlon in the creation of a future worldwide federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon|title=Histoire du triathlon|website=fftri.com|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160106140022/http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon|archive-date=6 January 2016|url-status=live|access-date=11 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the eleven nations that composed the ETU met in Brussels to standardise the national structures of each European country. During this time France dominated discussions, as it was the only federation recognised by its own National Olympic Committee. With the legitimacy from CONADET, forerunner of the French Triathlon Federation (FFTri), which has been organising triathlon in France since 1984 the French system became standard all over Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

=== A global federation ===
The  first attempt to create a global triathlon entity was the Triathlon Federation International (TFI), it had only 22 members most of which were national European federations. But immediately fights of influences broke out between the European and UK-American federations over many issues, particularly in view of a favourable vote system for the ETU, this causes immediate fracturing and the TFI never fully establish itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Around the same time, Canadian [[Les McDonald (triathlon)|Les McDonald]] held talks with [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], then President of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. Samaranch had already declared his intention to add triathlon to the Olympic games as fast as possible, and assured that triathlon could appear as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona but only under the auspices of the [[Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne|International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon]] (UIPMB).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fftri.com/la-federation/historique/|title=Historique de Triathlon 1994|website=FFTRI|language=fr-FR|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160106140022/http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon|archive-date=6 January 2016|url-status=|access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triathlon.org/about|title=Inside ITU|last=Union|first=International Triathlon|website=Triathlon.org|language=en|access-date=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many within the triathlon community were unhappy with the arrangement wishing for their own federation not to be held as part of UIPMB. Unable to accept the offer, Samaranch established an Olympic working committee for triathlon in an effort to form a consensus on an Olympic route for the sport. McDonald was selected as President of the committee, while Sweden's Sture Jonasson was elected as Secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;

Then in February 1989, an informal meeting was held in Vancouver, Canada where members of the working committee worked nonstop for a week on the statutes and regulations of the future [[International Triathlon Union]] (ITU). Then on 1 April 1989, 30 National Federations attended the first ITU Congress in [[Avignon]], France. After further discussions on the way forward to reach the Olympics, including the refusal to follow the path of the UIPMB and how triathlon should develop both economically and as a sport, the Congress endorses the creation of the International Triathlon Union and elects its first executive committee. McDonald was elected President. The city of Avignon is also give the honour of hosting the first World Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fftri.com/la-federation/historique/|title=Historique de Triathlon 1989|website=FFTRI|language=fr-FR|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160106140022/http://fftri.com/lhistoire-du-triathlon|archive-date=6 January 2016|url-status=|access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the IOC recognized the ITU as the sole governing body for the sport of triathlon at its 97th session in [[Birmingham]], UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatriathlon.org/content/index/1691|archive-url=https://archive.today/20090125081125/http://usatriathlon.org/content/index/1691|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 January 2009|title=History of Triathlon {{!}} Content {{!}} USA Triathlon|date=25 January 2009|website=archive.li|access-date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the Pan American Games approved triathlon for competition at the 1995 Pan Am Games in [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina. Then in September 1994, triathlon was added to the Olympic program as a medal earning sport at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

==Organisations==
The [[International Triathlon Union]] (ITU) was founded in 1989 as the international governing body of the sport, with the chief goal, at that time, of putting triathlon on the Olympic program.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS Olympics2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/u/olympics/2000/history/triathlon.htm|title=Olympic History: Triathlon|last=|first=|date=|work=|accessdate=4 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182537/http://www.cbssports.com/u/olympics/2000/history/triathlon.htm|archive-date=10 March 2012|publisher=CBS Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITU sanctions and organises the [[ITU World Triathlon Series|World Triathlon Series]] and [[ITU Triathlon World Cup|World Cup]] races each year, with annual world champions crowned each year for elite pro-triathletes, junior pro-triathletes, and age-group athletes. ITU races are conducted in a [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|draft]] legal format for the bike leg, whereas drafting is not permitted at the amateur level. In addition, the ITU has a Long Distance Triathlon series.

The [[World Triathlon Corporation]] (WTC) is a private company that sanctions and organises the [[Ironman triathlon|Ironman]] and [[Ironman 70.3]] races each year. These races serve as qualifying events for their own annual World Championships. The Ironman World Championship is held annually in [[Kailua-Kona, Hawaii]] in October while the Ironman 70.3 World Championship is held in September and changes location each year. The &quot;Ironman&quot; and &quot;Iron&quot; brands are property of the WTC. Therefore, long-distance multi-sport events organized by groups other than the WTC may not officially be called &quot;Ironman&quot; or &quot;Iron&quot; races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/58837|title=Iron Man calls this fight a draw|last=Williams|first=Pete|date=8 April 2008|accessdate=24 June 2010|publisher=Street &amp; Smith's Sports Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the ITU does not sanction WTC races;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITU Vote2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triathlon.org/news/article/congress_votes_to_no_longer_sanction_ironman/|title=Congress votes to no longer sanction Ironman|date=14 September 2005|publisher=International Triathlon Union|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, USAT uses a combination of ITU and WTC rules to sanction WTC's branded events.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT&amp;WTC2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slowtwitch.com/headings/ironman.html|title=Ironman and USAT are again brothers in arms|date=27 March 2006|publisher=Slowtwitch.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718171602/http://www.slowtwitch.com/headings/ironman.html|archivedate=18 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other organisations exist from local clubs hosting one 100 entrant race a year up to companies like the Challenge Family brand produces long-distance events around the world, and includes events like [[Challenge Roth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challenge-family.com/about-challenge-family/|title=About Challenge Family|publisher=TEAMChallenge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106211906/http://www.challenge-family.com/about-challenge-family/|archivedate=6 January 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Ultra-Triathlon Association (IUTA) is the official governing body of [[Ultratriathlon]], which involves triathlon in distances longer than an iron-distance race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iutasport.com/|title=International Ultra-Triathlon Association|publisher=International Ultra Triathlon Association|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Triathlon_pictogram.svg|thumb|The symbol for triathlon in the Olympics]]

=== Conflict ===
Two major rule making bodies, the ITU and WTC, had an overlap of rules and authority, an issue which began to create conflict in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.runningnetworkarchives.com/runnertriathletenews/news/413.html|title=Ironman Triathlon to take ITU to court to retain name|website=runningnetworkarchives.com|access-date=15 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in 2005 when the ITU and USAT asked all national triathlon federations to refuse to continue sanctioning any WTC events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/usat_breaks_with_ironman_races|title=USAT Breaks with Ironman Races|last=Union|first=International Triathlon|date=13 June 2005|website=Triathlon.org|language=en|access-date=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this stemmed from WTC not recognising the ITU as the sport's governing body as WTC was attempting to set up their own federation. Furthermore, ITU and USAT argued against supporting WTC because they were a profit driven organisation, that it was directly conflicting with ITU titles, such as the long and standard distance world championship, and that the WTC was not following [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) rules. If ITU member nations did not comply with International Olympic Committee (IOC) Charter rules they risked being excluded from the Olympic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/congress_votes_to_no_longer_sanction_ironman|title=Congress votes to no longer sanction Ironman|last=Union|first=International Triathlon|date=14 September 2005|website=Triathlon.org|language=en|access-date=21 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006, the ITU backed down on its stance allowing national federations to once again sanction WTC events. This was due to an out of court settlement days before a lawsuit at the court for the arbitration of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/itu_and_wtc_agree_to_settle_out_of_court|title=ITU and WTC Agree to Settle Out of Court|last=Union|first=International Triathlon|date=5 May 2006|website=Triathlon.org|language=en|access-date=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement had a large effect on WTC races including WADA membership for the WTC and out of competition testing for elite athletes.

Since 2008, coinciding with leadership changes at both the ITU and WTC, the two organisations have been slowly working together. Efforts in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ironman.com/triathlon-news/articles/2012/01/itu-and-wtc-look-to-work-together.aspx|title=ITU and WTC Look to Work Together|website=IRONMAN.com|language=en-US|access-date=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/itu_ironman_hold_historic_meeting|title=ITU &amp; IRONMAN hold historic meeting|last=Union|first=International Triathlon|date=23 June 2014|website=Triathlon.org|language=en|access-date=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the announcement that Ironman would standardise the rule set for its 2015 races, and would start the unification toward ITU rules on long distance racing with specific interest on the drafting and penalty rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://triathlonmagazine.ca/news/ironman-itu-confirm-global-standarization/|title=Ironman and ITU confirm global standarization|date=13 February 2015|website=Triathlon Magazine Canada|language=en-CA|access-date=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.endurancebusiness.com/2015/industry-news/aligning-with-itu-global-standardization-of-ironman-competition-rules/|title=Aligning with ITU: global standardization of IRONMAN competition rules|last=Gary|date=13 February 2015|website=endurancebusiness.com|language=en-GB|access-date=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the ITU and WTC signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two organisations stated they will:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eu.ironman.com/triathlon/news/articles/2017/01/ironman-partners-with-itu.aspx|title=IRONMAN Partners with the International Triathlon Union|website=IRONMAN.com|language=en-US|access-date=16 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Harmonise anti-doping efforts
* Fully establish the ITU as the singular international federation for triathlon
* Develop a unified athlete focused rule set for specific distance categories
* Align efforts to foster the growth and development of the sport

|}

Triathlons longer than full distance are classed as [[Ultra-triathlon]]s.

Triathlons are not necessarily restricted to these prescribed distances. Distances can be any combination of distance set by race organizers to meet various distance constraints or to attract a certain type of athlete.

The standard Olympic distance of 1.5/40/10{{sp}}km (0.93/24.8/6.2{{sp}}miles) was created by longtime triathlon race director Jim Curl in the mid-1980s, after he and partner Carl Thomas produced the U.S. Triathlon Series (USTS) between 1982 and 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA HoF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatriathlon.org/news/2010/01/14/usa-triathlon-hall-of-fame-banquet-caps-memorable-weekend/30568|title=USA Triathlon Hall of Fame Banquet Caps Memorable Weekend|date=14 January 2010|publisher=USA Triathlon|accessdate=4 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107134304/http://www.usatriathlon.org/news/2010/01/14/usa-triathlon-hall-of-fame-banquet-caps-memorable-weekend/30568|archivedate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above distances, two new long distance events have appeared, the 111 and 222 events. The 111 distance is {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} swimming, {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} bicycling and {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} running, totalling {{convert|111|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The 222 distance is double that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://star-events.cc/site/index.php/en/star-events/tristar/general-info|title=TriStar Triathlon Events|publisher=Star Production SARL|accessdate=22 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314100517/http://star-events.cc/site/index.php/en/star-events/tristar/general-info|archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most triathlons are individual events. Another format is relay triathlons, where a team of competitors take turns to compete at a race; each competitor must do a segment of swimming, cycling and running. The [[ITU Team Triathlon World Championships]] began with two separate classifications for men and women. In 2009, it adopted a 4x4 mixed relay format, where each team has two men and two women. The [[triathlon at the Youth Olympic Games]] also has a 4x mixed relay since 2010, and the event will be introduced at the [[Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Summer Olympics]]

The ITU accepts a 5% margin of error in the cycle and run course distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=International Triathlon Union| year=2003| url=http://www2.triathlon.org/rules/rules-2003/general-competition-rules-revised-2003PDF.PDF| title=ITU Competition Rules| accessdate=13 December 2005| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614113838/http://www2.triathlon.org/rules/rules-2003/general-competition-rules-revised-2003PDF.PDF| archivedate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there can be some variation in race distances, particularly among short triathlons, most triathlons conform to one of those above standards.

==Race organization==
In general, participation in a triathlon requires an athlete to register and sign up in advance of the actual race. After registration, racers are often provided a race number, colored [[swim cap]], and, if the event is being electronically timed, a timing band. Athletes will either be provided or briefed on details of the course, rules, and any problems to look out for (road conditions, closures, traffic lights, [[aid station]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstTri&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Lance|last2=Motz|first2=Jason|title=First Triathlon: Your Perfect Plan to Success|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJdicyVqjRAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Meyer &amp; Meyer Verlag|isbn=978-1-84126-116-4|pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a major event, such as an [[Ironman Triathlon|Ironman]] or a long course championship, triathletes may be required to set up and check-in their bike in the transition area a day or two before the race start, leaving it overnight and under guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ironman.com/assets/files/races/worldchampionship/pdf/2009_Ford_Ironman_World_Championship_Athlete_Guide.pdf|title=2009 Athlete Information Guide&amp;nbsp;– Ironman World Championship|year=2009|publisher=Ironman&amp;nbsp;– World Triathlon Corporation|page=9|accessdate=15 June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007104151/http://ironman.com/assets/files/races/worldchampionship/pdf/2009_Ford_Ironman_World_Championship_Athlete_Guide.pdf|archivedate=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the race, before the start of competition, athletes will generally be provided with a bike rack to hold their bicycle and a small section of ground space for shoes, clothing, etc. in the transition area. In some triathlons, there are two transition areas, one for the swim/bike change, then one for the bike/run change at a different location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Plant|first=Mike|title=Triathlon: going the distance|year=1987|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=978-0-8092-4774-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzCIgpukwXAC&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Speedsuit.jpg|thumb|Competition and pressure for faster times have led to the development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, such as [[speedsuit]]s.]]
[[File:Parvati Shallow.jpg|thumb|Reality TV's &quot;Survivor&quot; winner, [[Parvati Shallow]], dressed to compete in the 2008 Nautica Triathlon Malibu Individual Open for females.]]
Racers are generally categorized into separate [[professional]] and [[amateur]] categories. Amateurs, who make up the large majority of triathletes, are often referred to as &quot;age groupers&quot; since they are typically further classified by sex and age; which offers the opportunity to compete against others of one's own gender and age group. The age groups are defined in five- or ten-year intervals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant&quot; /&gt; There is typically a lower age limit; which can vary from race to race. In some triathlons, heavier amateur athletes may have the option to compete against others closer to their own weight since weight is often considered an impediment to speed. As an example, under [[USA Triathlon]] rules, &quot;Clydesdale&quot; athletes are those men over {{convert|220|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, while &quot;Athena&quot; athletes are women over {{convert|165|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/rulebook.aspx|title=USA Triathlon Competitive Rules|date=January 2013|publisher=[[USA Triathlon]]|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other races and organizations can choose whether or not to offer Clydesdale- and Athena-type divisions and set their own weight standards.

Depending on the type and size of the race, there may be any of the following methods implemented to start the race. In a mass start, all athletes enter the water and begin the competition following a single start signal. In wave start events, smaller groups of athletes begin the race every few minutes. An athlete's wave is usually determined either by age group or by predicted swim time. Wave starts are more common in shorter races where a large number of amateur athletes are competing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanlon&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanlon|first=Thomas W.|title=The sports rules book|year=2009|publisher=Human Kinetics|edition=3|isbn=978-0-7360-7632-6|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is individual time trial starts, where athletes enter the water one at a time, a few seconds apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRMS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napervilletri.com/article.php?story=wavestart|title=Age Group Time Trial Swim Start|year=2010|publisher=HRMS Naperville Sprint Triathlon|accessdate=23 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810120445/http://www.napervilletri.com/article.php?story=wavestart|archivedate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The swim leg usually proceeds around a series of marked [[buoys]] before athletes exit the water near the transition area. Racers exit out of the water, enter the transition area, and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times have led to the development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals and slip their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don't wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.

The cycling stage proceeds around a marked course, typically on public roads. In many cases, especially smaller triathlons, roads are not closed to automobiles; however, traffic coordinators are often present to help control traffic. Typically, the cycling stage finishes back at the same transition area. Racers enter the transition area, rack their bicycles, and quickly change into running shoes before heading out for the final stage. The running stage usually ends at a separate finish line near the transition area.

In most races, &quot;[[aid station]]s&quot; located on the bike and run courses provide water and energy drinks to the athletes as they pass by. Aid stations at longer events may often provide various types of food as well, including such items as [[energy bar]]s, [[energy gel]]s, fruit, cookies, soup, and ice.

Once the triathletes have completed the event, there is typically another aid station for them to get water, fruit, and other post-race refreshments. Occasionally, at the end of larger or longer events, the provided amenities and post-race celebrations may be more elaborate.

==Rules of triathlon==
{{see also|Triathlon equipment}}
While specific rules for triathlon can vary depending on the governing body (e.g. USA Triathlon, [[International Triathlon Union|ITU]]), as well as for an individual race venue, there are some basic universal rules. Traditionally, triathlon is an individual sport and each athlete is competing against the course and the clock for the best time. As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from anyone else outside the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Common&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.usoc.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/24727/2010_Most_Commonly_Violated_Rules.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601235146/http://assets.usoc.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/24727/2010_Most_Commonly_Violated_Rules.pdf |archivedate=1 June 2010 |title=2010 Most Common Rules Violations|year=2010|publisher=USA Triathlon|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITU Rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triathlon.org/images/uploads/ituevents_competition-rules-2010_2010-02-11.pdf|title=ITU Competition Rules|date=23 January 2010|publisher=International Triathlon Union|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TriathlonHamburg.jpg|thumb|Transition area (bicycles) of [[Hamburg Triathlon]], 2002]]
Triathlons are timed in five sequential sections:
# from the start of the swim to the beginning of the first transition (swim time);
# from the beginning of the first transition to the end of the first transition (T1 time);
#from the start of the cycling to the end of the cycling leg (cycling time);
# from the beginning of the second transition to the end of the second transition (T2 time);
# finally from the start of the run to the end of the run, at which time the triathlon is completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITU Rules&quot; /&gt;

Results are usually posted on official websites and will show for each triathlete his/her swim time; cycle time (with transitions included); run time; and total time. Some races also post transition times separately.

Other rules of triathlon vary from race to race and generally involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT events in the swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below {{convert|78.1|F|C|disp=sqbr}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot;/&gt; and prohibitions against interference between athletes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITU Rules&quot; /&gt; Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and flotation aids are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot;/&gt;

One rule involving the cycle leg is that the competitor's helmet must be donned before the competitor mounts (or even takes possession of, in certain jurisdictions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://triathlonquebec.objectif226.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TQ_Reglements_2010_04_20.pdf |title=Triathlon Québec Règles de compétition |publisher=Triathlon Québec |date=17 May 2008|accessdate=27 June 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the bike and must remain on until the competitor has dismounted; the competitor is not required to wear the helmet when not on the bicycle (e.g. while repairing a mechanical problem). Failure to comply with this rule will result in disqualification.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITU Rules&quot; /&gt; Additionally, while on the bike course, all bicycles shall be propelled only by human force and human power. Other than pushing a bicycle, any propulsive action brought on by use of the hands is prohibited. Should a competitor's bike malfunction they can proceed with the race as long as they are doing so with their bicycle in tow.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot; /&gt; There are also strict rules regarding the 'bike mount' line. Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the [[London 2012 Olympics]] was awarded to [[Jonathan Brownlee]], a competitor from [[Great Britain]], for mounting his bike too early.)&lt;ref name=&quot;ITU Rules&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Triathlon.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triathlon.org/news/article/alistair_brownlee_storms_to_olympic_gold_at_london_2012|title=Alistair Brownlee storms to Olympic gold at London 2012|date=August 2012|publisher=International Triathlon Union|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting]] on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Penalty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/multisport-zone/rules-education/articles/time-penalties-37.aspx|title=Rules Education: Time Penalties|accessdate=5 March 2014|publisher=USA Triathlon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922065556/http://www.usatriathlon.org/about-multisport/multisport-zone/rules-education/articles/time-penalties-37.aspx|archive-date=22 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triathlon and fitness==
[[File:Triathlon swim montage.jpg|thumb|upright|Triathletes competing in the swim component of race. Wetsuits are common but not universal]]
Participants in triathlon often use the sport to improve or maintain their [[physical fitness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MensHealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/20-great-reasons-do-triathlon|title=20 Great Reasons to do a Triathlon|accessdate= 2 June 2011|date=6 July 2005|publisher=Men's Health|last=Harr|first=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dallam&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dallam|first=George M.|title=Championship Triathlon Training|year=2008|page=286|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-8154-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each sport being an endurance event, training for a triathlon provides [[cardiovascular]] [[Aerobic exercise|exercise]] benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/254575-cardio-exercise-ideas/|title=Cardio Exercise Ideas|accessdate=2 June 2011|publisher=Livestrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, triathletes encounter fewer injuries than those who only use running as part of their exercise routine due to the incorporation of low impact swim and bike training.&lt;ref name=&quot;StewSmith&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/military-fitness/running/triathlon-training|title=Triathlon Training|last=Smith|first=Stew|accessdate=2 June 2011|publisher=Military.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Triathletes spend many hours training for competitions, like other endurance event participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Finch|first=Michael|title=Triathlon Training|page=[https://archive.org/details/triathlontrainin0000finc/page/71 71]|year=2004|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-5444-7|url=https://archive.org/details/triathlontrainin0000finc/page/71}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three components that have been researched to improve endurance sports performance; aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Friel|first=Joe|title=Your Best Triathlon|page=15|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injuries that are incurred from long hours of a single activity are not as common in triathlon as they are in single sport events. The [[cross-training]] effect that athletes achieve from training for one sport by doing a second activity applies to triathlon training.&lt;ref name=&quot;StewSmith&quot;/&gt; Additional activities that triathletes perform for cross-training benefits are yoga, pilates, and weight training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gandolfo|first=Christina|title=The Woman Triathlete|pages=[https://archive.org/details/womantriathlete00chri/page/200 200–201]|year=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-5430-0|url=https://archive.org/details/womantriathlete00chri/page/200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swimming===
{{see also|Swimming (sport)}}
Triathletes will often use their legs less vigorously and more carefully than other swimmers, conserving their leg muscles for the cycle and run to follow. Many triathletes use altered swim strokes to compensate for turbulent, aerated water and to conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting]], following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use &quot;[[Dolphin dive|dolphin kicking]]&quot; and diving to make headway against waves, and [[body surfing]] to use a wave's energy for a bit of speed at the end of the swim stage. Also, open-water swims necessitate &quot;sighting&quot;: raising the head to look for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy.

Because open water swim areas are often cold and because wearing a wetsuit provides a competitive advantage, specialized [[Triathlon equipment#Triathlon-specific swim equipment|triathlon wetsuits]] have been developed in a variety of styles to match the conditions of the water. For example, wetsuits that are sleeveless and cut above the knee are designed for warmer waters, while still providing buoyancy. Wetsuits are legal in sanctioned events at which the surface water temperature is {{convert|78|F|C}} or less.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot;/&gt;  In non-sanctioned events or in &quot;age group&quot; classes where most racers are simply participating for the enjoyment of the sport instead of vying for official triathlon placing, wetsuits can often be used at other temperatures. Race directors will sometimes discourage or ban wetsuits if the water temperature is above {{convert|84|F|C}} due to overheating that can occur while wearing a wetsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://triathlonwetsuitstore.com/at-what-temps-can-you-use-a-wetsuit| title = At what temps can you use a wetsuit?| publisher = TriathlonWetsuitStore.com| accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rules have been implemented by race organizers regarding both wetsuit thickness as well as the use of &quot;swim skins;&quot; which need to be considered by those participating in future triathlons. Some triathlon sanctioning bodies have placed limits on the thickness of the wetsuit material. Under ITU and some national governing bodies' rules no wetsuit may have a thickness of more than {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triathlon.competitor.com/2010/06/news/usa-triathlon-adopts-new-wetsuit-regulation-starting-in-2013_10173|title=USA Triathlon Adopts New Wetsuit Regulation Starting In 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc.|date=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cycling===
{{see also|Bicycle racing}}
[[File:Triathlete on bike.jpg|thumb|upright|Triathlete in the cycling portion of the event]]
Triathlon cycling can differ from most professional bicycle racing depending on whether [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting]] is allowed during competition. In some competitions, like those governed by USA Triathlon and the World Triathlon Corporation, drafting is not allowed,&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT Rules&quot; /&gt; and thus the cycling portion more closely resembles [[individual time trial]] racing. In other races, such as those in [[ITU Triathlon World Cup|World Cup]] and [[ITU Triathlon World Championships|Championship]] racing, drafting and the formation of [[peloton]]s are legal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITU Rules&quot; /&gt; This places an emphasis on running performance as several athletes will enter the bike to run transition at the same time due to drafting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friel&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Friel|first=Joe|title=The Triathlete's Training Bible|year=2004|publisher=VeloPress|isbn=978-1-931382-42-7|url=https://archive.org/details/triathletestrain00joef_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Triathlon bicycles are generally optimized for aerodynamics, having special handlebars called [[Triathlon bars|aero-bars or tri-bars]], [[Disc wheels|aerodynamic wheels]], and other components. Triathlon bikes use a specialized geometry, including a steep [[Bicycle frame#Seat tube|seat-tube]] angle both to improve aerodynamics and to spare muscle groups needed for running (see also [[triathlon equipment]]). At the end of the bike segment, triathletes also often cycle with a higher [[cadence (cycling)|cadence]] (revolutions per minute), which serves in part to keep the muscles loose and flexible for running.

===Running===
{{see also|Running}}
[[File:WheelChairBoiseTriathalon70point3.jpg|thumb|upright|An athlete competes in a [[wheelchair]] amongst runners at Ironman 70.3 on the [[Boise Greenbelt]].]]
The primary distinguishing feature of running in a triathlon is that it occurs after the athlete has already been exercising in two other disciplines for an extended period of time, so many muscles are already tired. The effect of switching from cycling to running can be profound; first-time triathletes are often astonished at their [[muscle weakness]], which may be caused by lactate accumulation and the bizarre, sometimes painful sensation in their thighs a few hundred yards into the run, and discover that they run at a much slower pace than they are accustomed to in training. Triathletes train for this phenomenon through transition workouts known as &quot;bricks&quot;: back-to-back workouts involving two disciplines, most commonly cycling and running.

===Transition===
The change over from sport to sport takes place in a designated transition area. The transition provides a staging area where bicycles, running shoes, hydration and other gear is set up ready to be used during the course of the event. The first transition, known as ''T1'', is between the swim-to-bike segments of the race. The second transition,  ''T2'', is between the bike-to-run segments. Most events have one common transition area for both T1 and T2, while some point to point events have two separate transition areas. The time spent in transition is a timed segment and contributes towards the overall finishing time of the event.

* [[Ironman World Championship|Hawaii Ironman World Championship]], [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]], [[Hawaii]]. First held in 1978 on [[Oahu]], only five years after the sport of triathlon was founded; it was later moved to [[Kailua-Kona]] on the island of Hawaii. The cycling stage of the race covers more than {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} over lava flats on the big island of Hawaii, where mid-day temperatures often reach over {{convert|110|F|C|abbr=on}} and cross-winds sometimes blow at {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The race is often challenging even to competitors with experience in other iron-distance events. Being a world championship race, only competitors that meet qualifying guidelines can enter, typically qualifying slots are awarded in other Ironman sanctioned events.
* [[Nice Triathlon]], [[Nice]], France. A race that existed until 2002 when the course was adopted by the [[World Triathlon Corporation|WTC]] as Ironman France. During the 1980s the Nice Long Distance triathlon (swim {{convert|4|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}, bike {{convert|120|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}, run {{convert|30|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) was, alongside the World Championships in Kona, one of the two important races each year with prize money and media attention. [[Mark Allen (triathlete)|Mark Allen]] won here 10 consecutive times. The ITU's [[Triathlon#Standard race distances|Long Distance]] is a Nice-Distance race except during a short period from late 2006 to early 2008, in which it was {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} + {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} + {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}}.
* [[Enduroman|Enduroman Arch to Arc]]. A {{convert|289|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} triathlon from Marble Arch, London to the Arc de Triomphe, Paris. Run from Marble Arch in London to Dover {{convert|87|mi|km|order=flip}}, swim the English Channel {{convert|22|mi|km|order=flip}} to Calais, and then cycle {{convert|181|mi|km|order=flip}} from Calais to Paris. For this challenge, the clock starts at Marble Arch and stops at Arc de Triomphe. Only 24 people in history have completed this event.
* [[St. Anthony's Triathlon|St. Anthony's]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]]. Held in the last week of April every year, this race attracts professional and amateur triathletes from around the world. One of the largest Olympic Distance triathlon in the U.S. with over 4,000 participants each year.
* [[Escape from Alcatraz (triathlon)|Escape from Alcatraz]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. This non-standard-length race begins with a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} swim in frigid [[San Francisco Bay]] waters from [[Alcatraz]] Island to shore, followed by an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} bicycle and {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} run in the extremely hilly terrain of the San Francisco Bay Area. The run includes the notorious &quot;[[Dutch sand ladder|Sand Ladder]]&quot;, a 400-step staircase climb up a beachside cliff.
* [[Wildflower Triathlon|Wildflower]] is a half-iron distance race held on the first weekend of May at [[Lake San Antonio]] on the Central Coast of California since 1983. Known for a particularly hilly course, it has expanded now to include three races of different lengths and is one of the largest triathlon events in the world, with over 8,000 athletes attending each year.
