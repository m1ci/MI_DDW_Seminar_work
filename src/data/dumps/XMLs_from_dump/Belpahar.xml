[[File:Koilighugar Waterfall, Jharsuguda.jpg|thumb|View of Koili Ghoghar]]
A scenic tourist spot about forty-five minutes away from Belpahar Railway Station on the way to Raigarh, Koili Ghoghar houses a beautiful river carving its way out of rock faces and cascading down in steps.

There is also a Shiva temple and a temple venerating a local deity for those with a religious vein. The town also has a Maa Tarini temple, near the NAC Checkpost (which is not closed), in the dense forest

===Ullapgarh===
[[File:Ullapgarh.jpg|thumb|View of surrounding hillocks from Ullapgarh]]
This is a hillock about fifteen minutes away from Belpahar Railway Station. It is said that the revolutionaries fighting in the freedom struggle of India took refuge in this hillock. The spaces carved out from the rock face to hold torches can be seen to this day. The journey uphill entails one to be of a strong disposition as the sun and the dry heat can take their toll on one's bodily fluids. But once the summit is reached, it is a view to behold. Greenery combined with the piercing silence is a great restorative. It would be advised to remember one's way up lest one may find themselves going down by a completely different path and hence get lost. It one of the good picnic spots.
On the foot of Maheswar Pahad, there is a small village called &quot;Ulap&quot;. About one kilometer from the village, the ruins of Ulapgarh are situated. At this place, the Maheswar pahad is about 1000&amp;nbsp;ft high and on the top there is a huge plain surface.  On this rectangular plain stone surface the fort of Ulapgarh had been constructed.   The plain stone fine surface is about 400 metre long and 250 metre wide.  On the eastern side of the fort there are almost 7&amp;nbsp;km of densely forested Baramunda Hills and on the western side, the Belpahar Railway Station is located at a distance of 5&amp;nbsp;km. On the north there is a dense forest stretching up to Hemgir and in the south stretching up to Badjob village.

A 12&amp;nbsp;ft (3.66&amp;nbsp;m) wide and 500&amp;nbsp;ft (150&amp;nbsp;m) long moat had been constructed which stretches from east to west.  There was a Sivalingam and a place of worship in the Fort.  A well had been dug on the stone floor which provided drinking water to the inmates of the Fort throughout the year.

On the stone floor, there are many square holes and 70 round holes.  The diameters of the hole vary from 1-3 inch. Wooden poles used to be put on these holes to support super structures for living room, store room, arsenals, Kitchen, sleeping room etc.

About 1000 people could take shelter at Ulapgarh at a time. On the western side of Ulapgarh and down hill there is Ushakothi cave.  On the walls and floors of this cave also there are many circular and square holes.  Probably the defence personnel of the fort used to suspend there clothes and other belonging from wooden poles fitted to these holes.  The soldiers of the dense forest of Maheswar hill could easily over power and defeat the enemies before they could climb up the hill and attack the fort.

It is believed that Ulapgarh was being used as a residential fort by some kings of &quot;Naja&quot; Dynasty. Research is going on by various Indian and Foreign researchers and Historian in this direction.
