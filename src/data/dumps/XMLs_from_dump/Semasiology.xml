'''Semasiology''' (from {{lang-el|links=no|σημασία}}, ''{{transl|la|semasia}}'', &quot;signification&quot;) is a discipline of [[linguistics]] concerned with the question &quot;what does the word ''X'' mean?&quot;. It studies the meaning of words regardless how they are pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/slt/abc/lt2/lt2-7632.htm Словарь литературных терминов, семасиология (ru. Dictionary of literary terms, semasiology)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of [[onomasiology]], a branch of [[lexicology]] that starts with a concept or object and asks for its name, i.e., &quot;how do you express X?&quot; whereas semasiology starts with a word and asks for its meanings.&lt;!-- Attribution of the text I added (December 18, 2016) re: comparing semasiology and onomasiology: [[Onomasiology]] --&gt;

The exact meaning of semasiology is somewhat obscure. It is often used as a synonym of [[Semantics#Linguistics|semantics]] (the study of the meaning of words, phrases, and longer forms of expression).&lt;!-- Attribution of the text I added (December 18, 2016) re: the  definition of semantics: [[Semantics#Linguistics]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070108095538/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/101/067.htm Semasiologia, Culture at Vologda region]&lt;/ref&gt; However, semasiology is also sometimes considered part of [[lexical semantics]], a narrow subfield of lexicology (the study of words) and semantics.

The term was first used in German by [[Christian Karl Reisig]] in 1825 in his work, [''Lectures on Latin Linguistics''] ({{lang-de|links=no|Vorlesungen über lateinische Sprachwissenschaft}}), and was used in English by 1847. Semantics replaced it in its original meaning, beginning in 1893.
