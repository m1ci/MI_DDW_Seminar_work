'''Snooker''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|s|n|uː|k|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|s|n|ʊ|k|ər}})&lt;ref name=&quot;Macmillan British&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macmillan American&quot; /&gt; is a [[cue sports|cue sport]] that originated among [[British Army]] officers stationed in [[India]] in the second half of the 19th century. It is played on a [[Billiard table#Snooker tables|rectangular table]] covered with a green cloth (or &quot;[[baize]]&quot;), with [[Billiard table#Pockets 2|pockets]] at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a [[cue stick]] and 21 [[Billiard ball#Snooker|coloured balls]], players must strike the white ball (or &quot;cue ball&quot;) to {{glossary link|glossary=Glossary of cue sports terms|pot}} or {{glossary link|glossary=Glossary of cue sports terms|pocket}} the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game (or {{cuegloss|frame}}), is won by the player scoring the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames.

Snooker gained its identity in 1875 when army officer [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Sir Neville Chamberlain]] (1856–1944), stationed in [[Ooty]], [[Tamil Nadu]], devised a set of rules that combined [[pyramid pool|pyramid]] and [[black pool]]. The word ''snooker'' was a long-used military term for inexperienced or first-year personnel. The game grew in popularity in the United Kingdom, and the [[Billiards Association and Control Club]] was formed in 1919. It is now governed by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA).

The [[World Snooker Championship]] has taken place since [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]]. [[Joe Davis]], a key figure in the early growth of the sport, won the championship 15 straight times between 1927 and 1946. The &quot;modern era&quot; began in 1969 after the broadcaster [[BBC]] commissioned the snooker television show ''[[Pot Black]]'' and later began to air the World Championship in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]]. Key figures in the game were [[Ray Reardon]] in the 1970s, [[Steve Davis]] in the 1980s, and [[Stephen Hendry]] in the 1990s, each winning six or more World championships. Since 2000, [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won the most world titles, with five. Top professional players now compete regularly around the world and earn millions of pounds on the [[World Snooker Tour]], which features players from across the world.

==History==
{{Main|History of snooker}}
[[File:Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Sir Neville Chamberlain]], a British Army officer who devised the game and its rules in the late 19th century]]
The origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot; /&gt; In the 1870s, [[English billiards|billiards]] was a popular activity among [[British Army]] officers stationed in [[India]], and several variations of the game were devised during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot; /&gt; One variation that originated at the officers' [[mess]] of the 11th [[Devonshire Regiment]] in 1875&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage2008&quot; /&gt; combined the rules of two [[pocket billiards]] games: [[pyramid pool|pyramid]] and [[black pool]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville Chamberlain disambiguation&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FullHistory&quot; /&gt; The former was played with fifteen red coloured balls positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated balls.&lt;ref name=&quot;FullHistory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamos 1994&quot; /&gt; The game was developed in 1884 when its first set of rules was finalised by [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Sir Neville Chamberlain]],{{efn|not the [[Neville Chamberlain|Prime Minister]] of the same name}} an English army officer who helped develop and popularise the game at [[Stone House, Ooty|Stone House]] in [[Ooty]] (Ootacamund) on a table built by [[Burroughes &amp; Watts]] that was brought over by boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph2014&quot; /&gt;

The word ''snooker'' was a slang term for first-year cadets and inexperienced military personnel, but Chamberlain would often use it for the performance of one of his fellow officers at the table.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot; /&gt; In 1887, snooker was given its first definite reference in England in a copy of ''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' which caused a growth in popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage2008&quot; /&gt; Chamberlain came out as the game's inventor in a letter to ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' published on 19 March 1938, 63 years after the fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage2008&quot; /&gt;

Snooker grew in popularity across the Indian colonies and the United Kingdom, but it remained a game mainly for the [[gentry]], and many [[gentlemen's club]]s that had a billiards table would not allow non-members inside to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage2008&quot; /&gt; To accommodate the growing interest, smaller and more open snooker-specific clubs were formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage2008&quot; /&gt; In 1919, the Billiards Association and the Billiards Control Board merged to form the [[Billiards Association and Control Club]] (BA&amp;CC) and a new, standard set of rules for snooker first became official.{{sfn|Gadsby|Williams|2012|p=8}}

In [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]] the first [[World Snooker Championship]] was organised by [[Joe Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot; /&gt;{{efn|The event was known then as the Professional Snooker Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProfessionalChampionship&quot; /&gt;}} Davis, as a professional [[English billiards]] and snooker player, moved the game from a [[Hobby|pastime]] to a professional activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CnVTimeline&quot; /&gt; Davis won every world championship until 1946, when he retired from the championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;5J29x&quot; /&gt; The game went into a decline through the 1950s and 1960s with little interest generated outside of those who played.&lt;ref name=&quot;smhday6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FullHistory&quot; /&gt; In 1959, Davis introduced a variation of the game known as &quot;[[Snooker Plus]]&quot; to try to improve the game's popularity by adding two extra colours, but this failed to gain interest.&lt;ref name=day1&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p3dAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dKMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2895%2C8253550 |date=27 October 1959 |page=10 |title=Snooker Plus |access-date=27 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505071329/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p3dAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dKMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2895,8253550 |archive-date=5 May 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=27 October 1959 |page=17 |title=J Davis launches Snooker Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, [[David Attenborough]] commissioned the snooker television series ''[[Pot Black]]'' to demonstrate the potential of [[Color television#Europe|colour television]], with the green table and multi-coloured balls being ideal for showing off the advantages of colour broadcasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;FullHistory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news_BBCS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cue China&quot; /&gt; The series became a ratings success and was for a time the second-most popular show on [[BBC2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FCS-PB&quot; /&gt; Interest in the game increased and the [[1978 World Snooker Championship]] was the first to be fully televised.&lt;ref name=&quot;commonwealth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OTT-40&quot; /&gt; The game quickly became a mainstream game in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianThatch&quot; /&gt; [[Ireland]] and much of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], and has enjoyed much success since the late 1970s, with most of the ranking tournaments being televised.&lt;ref name=&quot;FullHistory&quot; /&gt; By the [[1985 World Snooker Championship]] a total of 18.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers watched the [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|concluding frame of the final]] between [[Dennis Taylor]] and [[Steve Davis]], a record viewership for the United Kingdom for any broadcast after midnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsoH1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inde_Grea&quot; /&gt; In the early 2000s, a ban on [[tobacco advertising]] led to a decrease in the number of professional tournaments,&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianSponsor&quot; /&gt; with professional tournaments being cut to only 15 events in 2003, from 22 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;snoo_WWWS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snoo_WWWS_GThzD&quot; /&gt; However, the popularity of the game in Asia, with emerging talents such as [[Liang Wenbo]] and more established players such as [[Ding Junhui]] and [[Marco Fu]], boosted the sport in the Far East.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeebDing2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeebDing1&quot; /&gt; By 2007, the BBC dedicated 400 hours to snooker coverage, compared to just 14 minutes 40 years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;gE3Ec&quot; /&gt;

In 2010, promoter [[Barry Hearn]] gained a controlling interest in World Snooker Ltd. and the [[World Snooker Tour]], pledging to revitalise the &quot;moribund&quot; professional game.&lt;ref name=&quot;fUEoB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;peHgu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theg_Barr&quot; /&gt; Since this time, the number of professional tournaments has increased, with 44 events in the 2019/20 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;snoo_Cale&quot; /&gt; Events have also been made to be more suitable for television broadcasts, such as the [[Snooker Shoot-Out]], a timed, one-{{cuegloss|frame}} tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;worl_2019&quot; /&gt; Prize money for professional events has also increased, with top players making several million pounds during their careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFuYf&quot; /&gt; The winner of the [[2020 World Snooker Championship]] will receive £500,000 out of a total fund of £2,395,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prize&quot; /&gt;

==Rules==
{{Main|Rules of snooker}}

===Objective===
[[File:Snooker table drawing 2.svg|thumb|[[Billiard table#Snooker tables|Snooker table]] with balls placed in their starting positions. At the start of the game, the cue ball (white) may be placed anywhere in the semicircle, known as the &quot;D&quot;.]]
[[File:To pot the red.jpg|thumb|A game played on a half-size table. The player is striking at the cue ball to pot a red ball into the corner pocket.]]

The objective of the game is to score more {{Cuegloss|Point|points}} than one's opponent by potting {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object balls}} in the correct order. At the start of a frame, the balls are positioned as shown in the first image, and the players then take turns hitting shots by striking the cue ball with the {{Cuegloss|Cue tip|tip}} of the [[Cue stick|cue]], their aim being to pot one of the red balls into a pocket and thereby score a point. Failure to make contact with the red ball constitutes a foul shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt; If the striker pots a red ball, he or she must then pot one of the six &quot;colours&quot;.{{efn|In snooker, the term ''colour'' is understood to exclude the red balls.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt;}} If the player successfully pots a colour, the value of that ball is added to the player's score, and the ball is returned to its starting position on the table. After that, the player must pot another red ball, then another colour, in sequence. This process continues until the striker fails to pot the desired ball, at which point the opponent comes to the table to play the next shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt; The act of scoring sequentially in this manner is to make a {{cuegloss|break}} (see scoring below).&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Snooker break.ogv|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of a snooker break-off shot]]

The game continues in this manner until all the reds are potted and only the six colours are left on the table.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt; At this point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valuable ball, as per the table to the right. The shots are: yellow first (two points), then green (three points), brown (four points), blue (five points), pink (six points) and black (seven points), the balls not being returned to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt; When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt; If the scores are equal when all the balls have been potted, the black is placed back on its spot as a [[tiebreaker]]. In this situation, called {{cuegloss|re-spotted black}}, the black ball is placed on its designated spot and the cue ball is played as {{cuegloss|ball in hand}}. The referee then tosses a coin and the winner decides which player goes first. The frame continues until one of the players pots the black ball or commits a foul.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt; A player may also concede a frame while on strike if he or she thinks there are not enough points available on the table to beat the opponent's score. In professional snooker this is a common occurrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rule_Snoo&quot; /&gt;
Professional and competitive amateur matches are officiated by a referee. The referee also replaces the colours on the table when necessary and calls out how many points the player has scored during a break.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scorboard&quot; /&gt; Professional players usually play the game in a sporting manner, declaring fouls which they have committed but the referee has missed,&lt;ref name=&quot;belf_Mark&quot; /&gt; acknowledging good shots from their opponent, and holding up a hand to apologise for fortunate shots, known as &quot;flukes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;belf_Mark&quot; /&gt;

===Scoring===
Points in snooker are gained from potting the correct balls in sequence. The total number of consecutive points (excluding fouls) that a player amasses during one {{Cuegloss|Visit|visit}} to the table is known as a break. A player attaining a break of 15, for example, could have reached it by potting a red then a black, then a red then a pink, before failing to pot the next red. A [[maximum break]] in snooker is achieved by potting all reds with blacks then all colours, yielding 147 points; this is often known as a &quot;147&quot; or just as a &quot;maximum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC147&quot; /&gt;

Points may also be scored in a game when a player's opponent {{Cuegloss|Foul|fouls}}. A foul can occur for various reasons, most commonly for failing to hit the correct ball (e.g. hitting a colour first when the player was attempting to hit a red), or for sending the cue ball into a pocket. The former may occur when the player fails to escape from a &quot;{{Cuegloss|Snooker|snooker}}&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a situation in which the previous player leaves the cue ball positioned such that no legal ball can be struck directly without obstruction by an illegal ball. Points gained from a foul vary from a minimum of four to a maximum of seven if the black ball is involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt;

A foul shot that leaves no valid shot for the opponent can leave them a {{Cuegloss|free ball}}. A free ball allows a player to use any other coloured ball in place of the shot they were supposed to play. Doing so with all 15 red balls in play can result in a break exceeding a maximum, with the highest possible being a [[Maximum break#Breaks exceeding 147|155 break]], achieved via the opponent leaving a {{Cuegloss|free ball}}, with the black being potted as the additional colour, and then potting 15 reds and blacks with the colours.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsrulessnooker&quot; /&gt; [[Jamie Cope]] has the distinction of being the first player in snooker history to post a verified 155 break, achieved in a practice frame in 2005, with other players such as [[Alex Higgins]] also claiming to have made a similar break.&lt;ref name=&quot;belf_Alex&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pund_147I&quot; /&gt;

One {{Cuegloss|Game|game}}, from the balls in their starting position until the last ball is potted, is called a &quot;{{Cuegloss|Frame|frame}}&quot;. A {{Cuegloss|Match|match}} generally consists of a predetermined number of frames and the player who wins the most frames wins the match. Most professional matches require a player to win five frames, and are called &quot;best of nine&quot; in reference to the maximum possible number of frames. Tournament finals are usually best of 17 or best of 19, while the world championship uses longer matches&amp;nbsp;– ranging from best of 19 in the qualifiers and the first round up to best of 35 for the final (first to 18), and is played over four sessions of play held over two days.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWSN1&quot; /&gt;

==Governance and tournaments==

{{See also|List of snooker tournaments|Category:Snooker organisations|l2=Snooker organisations}}
The [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA, also known as World Snooker), founded in 1968 as the Professional Billiard Players' Association,&lt;ref name=&quot;wpbsafounding&quot; /&gt; is the governing body for the professional competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;biggestbreak&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;infighting2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;infighting3&quot; /&gt; The amateur game (including youth competition) is governed by the [[International Billiards and Snooker Federation]] (IBSF).&lt;ref name=&quot;ibsf&quot; /&gt; Events held specifically for women and events for seniors are handled by World Snooker under [[World Women's Snooker]] and the [[World Seniors Tour]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;LANCS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;J3Vse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;worl_WPBS&quot; /&gt; The highest levels of the sport are the [[IBSF World Snooker Championship]], [[World Seniors Championship]] and the [[Ladies World Snooker Championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;worl_WPBS&quot; /&gt; 

===Tournaments===
====Professional====
Professional snooker players play on the World Snooker Tour. Events on the Tour are only open to players on the Tour and selected amateur players, but most events require qualification. Players can qualify for the Tour either by being high enough on the world rankings from prior seasons, winning continental championships, or through the [[Challenge Tour (snooker)|Challenge Tour]] or [[Q School (snooker)|Q School]] events.&lt;ref name=&quot;qualifortour&quot; /&gt; Players on the Tour generally gain two-year participation for the events.&lt;ref name=&quot;qualifortour&quot; /&gt;

The Tour also has an official world rankings scheme, with only players on the Tour receiving a ranking. [[Snooker world rankings|Ranking points]], earned by players through their performances over the previous two seasons, determine the current world rankings.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSrankingchart&quot; /&gt; A player's ranking determines what level of qualification he or she requires for specific tournaments. The elite of professional snooker are generally regarded as the &quot;top-16&quot; ranking players.&lt;ref name=&quot;top16-1&quot; /&gt; They are not required to pre-qualify for some of the tournaments, such as the [[Shanghai Masters (snooker)|Shanghai Masters]], the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] and the World Snooker Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;top16-2&quot; /&gt; Certain other events, such as those in the [[Coral Cup (snooker)|Coral Cup series]], use the one-year ranking list to qualify; these use the results of the current season to denote participants.&lt;ref name=&quot;news_Cora&quot; /&gt; Currently, the Tour contains 125 players, with players either in the top 64 on the official ranking list, or finishing as one of the top eight prize money earners during the most recent season, guaranteed a tour place for the next season, this being assessed after the World Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wpbsa.com/tour-survival-2019-five-to-go/ |title=Tour Survival 2019: Five to Go |publisher=World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|date= |website=wpbsa.com |access-date=7 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Snooker Championship Trophy edited.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[World Snooker Championship]] trophy]]
The oldest professional snooker tournament is the World Championship,&lt;ref name=&quot;wsc1&quot; /&gt; held annually since 1927 (except during [[World War II]] and between 1958 and 1963).&lt;ref name=&quot;World Snooker list&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vDR55&quot; /&gt; The tournament has been held at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], England, since 1977, and was sponsored by [[Imperial Tobacco|Embassy]] from 1976 to 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianSponsor&quot; /&gt; Since the ban on advertising tobacco products, the championships have been sponsored by betting companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;sponsor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Np1Uq&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cgzeF&quot; /&gt;

The World Championship is the most highly valued prize in professional snooker&lt;ref name=&quot;wcvalue&quot; /&gt; in terms of financial reward (£500,000 for the winner, formerly £300,000), ranking points and prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;wcprizemoney&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings_and_era_dominance&quot; /&gt; It is televised extensively in the UK by the [[BBC]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_deal&quot; /&gt; and gains significant coverage in Europe on [[Eurosport]]&lt;ref name=&quot;eurosport_deal&quot; /&gt; and in East Asia on [[CCTV-5]].&lt;ref name=&quot;worl_Tour&quot; /&gt; The World Championships is part of the [[Triple Crown (snooker)|Triple Crown]] along with the [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] and the non-ranking Masters.&lt;ref name=&quot;dottmasters&quot; /&gt; These events are valued by some players as the most prestigious, and are also some of the oldest competitions.  Winning all three events is a difficult task, and has only been done by 11 players.&lt;ref name=&quot;QqJ6D&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;top16-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dottmasters&quot; /&gt;

With some events having been criticised for matches taking too long,&lt;ref name=&quot;yawn&quot; /&gt; an alternative series of timed tournaments has been organised by [[Matchroom Sport]] chairman [[Barry Hearn]]. The shot-timed [[Premier League Snooker]] was established, with seven players invited to compete at regular United Kingdom venues, televised on [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings_and_era_dominance&quot; /&gt; Players had twenty-five seconds to take each shot, with five time-outs per player per match. While some success was achieved with this format, it generally did not receive the same amount of press attention or status as the regular ranking tournaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;yawn&quot; /&gt; This event has been taken out of the tour since 2013, when the [[Champion of Champions (snooker)|Champion of Champions]] was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.e_O'Su&quot; /&gt; The Champion of Champions saw players qualify by virtue of winning other events in the season, with 16 champions competing.&lt;ref name=&quot;cham_Cham&quot; /&gt;{{efn|Under certain circumstances, some runners-up participate at the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;cham_Cham&quot; /&gt;
}}

In 2015, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association submitted an unsuccessful bid for snooker to be played at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ghz8N&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eN1gH&quot; /&gt; Another bid has been put forward for [[2024 Summer Olympics]] through the [[World Snooker Federation]], founded in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;KpBpW&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T9wCo&quot; /&gt; A trial for the format for cue sports to be played at the 2024 games was put forward at the [[2019 World Team Trophy (cue sports)|2019 World Team Trophy]], also featuring [[nine-ball]] and [[carom billiards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;azbi_Inau&quot; /&gt; Snooker has been contested at the [[World Games]] since [[Cue sports at the 2001 World Games|2001]], and was included as an event at the [[Snooker at the 2019 African Games|2019 African Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jtHKc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eN7hQ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074080/snooker-to-feature-as-medal-event-at-2019-african-games-in-morocco|title=Snooker to feature as medal event at 2019 African Games in Morocco|date=11 January 2019|publisher=Inside the Games|accessdate=8 December 2019|archive-date=2 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190802213523/https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074080/snooker-to-feature-as-medal-event-at-2019-african-games-in-morocco|first=Michael|last=Pavitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Several players, such as Ronnie O'Sullivan, [[Mark Allen (snooker player)|Mark Allen]] and Steve Davis, have warned that there are too many tournaments during the season, and that players risk burning out.&lt;ref name=&quot;JrHL1&quot; /&gt; In 2012, O'Sullivan played fewer tournaments in order to spend more time with his children, and ended the 2012–13 season ranked 19th in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;JrHL1&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, he did not play any tournament in 2013 except the World Championship, which he won.&lt;ref name=&quot;JrHL1&quot; /&gt; O'Sullivan has suggested that a &quot;breakaway tour&quot; with fewer events would be beneficial to the sport, but as of 2019 no such tour has been organised.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc._Ronn&quot; /&gt;

Some leagues have allowed clubs to refuse to accept women players in tournaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bIhfn&quot; /&gt; League committee leadership defended the practice, saying, &quot;If we lose two of these clubs [with the men-only policies] we would lose four teams and we can't afford to lose four teams otherwise we would have no league.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; A [[World Women's Snooker Championship|World Women's Snooker]] spokesperson said, &quot;It is disappointing and unacceptable that in 2019 that players such as [[Rebecca Kenna]] have been the victim of antiquated discriminatory practices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The [[All-Party Parliamentary Group]] said, &quot;The group believes that being prevented from playing in a club because of gender is archaic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

{{see also|Comparison of cue sports|Glossary of cue sports terms}}
[[File:London - Royal Automobile Club - 3024.jpg|thumb|right| Cue-tip chalk, cue, white chalk-board chalk, and a sliding score-keeper]]
[[#Equipment|Accessories]] used for snooker include {{Cuegloss|Chalk|chalk}} for the tip of the cue, {{Cuegloss|Rest|rests}} of various sorts used for playing shots that cannot be played by hand, a [[Rack (billiards)|triangle]] to {{Cuegloss|Rack|rack}} the reds, and a scoreboard. One drawback of snooker on a full-size ({{convert|12|×|6|ft|cm|abbr=on|disp=sqbr|0}}) table is the size of the room ({{convert|22|x|16|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}), which is the minimum required for comfortable cueing room on all sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;roomsize&quot; /&gt; This limits the number of locations in which the game can easily be played. While [[Billiard table#Pool (pocket billiards) tables|pool tables]] are common to many [[Public house|pubs]], snooker tends to be played either in private surroundings or in public [[Billiard hall|snooker halls]]. The game can also be played on smaller tables using fewer red balls. Variant table sizes include {{convert|10|×|5|ft|cm|abbr=on|0}}, {{convert|9|×|4.5|ft|cm|abbr=on|0}}, {{convert|8|×|4|ft|cm|abbr=on|0}}, {{convert|6|×|3|ft|cm|abbr=on|0}} (the smallest for realistic play) and {{convert|4|×|2|ft|cm|abbr=on|0}}. Smaller tables can come in a variety of styles, such as fold-away or dining-table convertible.&lt;ref name=&quot;snoo_Pool&quot; /&gt;

A traditional snooker scoreboard resembles an [[abacus]] and records the score for each frame in units and twenties and the frame scores. They are typically attached to a wall by the snooker table. A simple scoring bead is also sometimes used, called a &quot;scoring string&quot;, or &quot;scoring wire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scorboard&quot; /&gt; Each bead (segment of the string) represents a single point. Snooker players typically move one or several beads with their cue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scorboard&quot; /&gt;

The playing surface is 356.9&amp;nbsp;cm (11&amp;nbsp;feet 8.5&amp;nbsp;inches) by 177.8&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;feet 10&amp;nbsp;inches) for a standard full-size [[Billiard table#Snooker and English billiards tables|table]], with six pocket holes, one at each corner and one at the centre of each of the longer side cushions.&lt;ref name=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cuesport equipment |author= |work=ActiveSG |date= |access-date=16 September 2019 |url= https://www.myactivesg.com/Sports/Billiards-and-Snooker/How-To-Play/Billiards-and-Snooker-for-Beginners/Cuesport-equipment |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fully wool cloth is usually green, with a [[Billiard table#Cloth|directional nap]] running from the baulk end of the table towards the end with the black ball spot. The cloth is often called &quot;baize&quot;; although true baize is a lower quality cloth sometimes used on pool tables. The nap will affect the direction of the cue ball depending on which direction the cue ball is shot and also on whether left or right side (spin) is placed on the ball. Even if the cue ball is hit in exactly the same way, the nap will cause a different effect depending on whether the ball is hit down table (towards the black ball spot) or up table (towards the baulk line). The cloth on a snooker table is not vacuumed, as this can destroy the nap. The cloth is brushed in a straight line from the baulk end to the far end with multiple brush strokes that are straight in direction (i.e. not across the table). Some table men will also then drag a dampened cloth wrapped around a short piece of board (like a [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two by four]]), or straight back of a brush to collect any remaining fine dust and help lay the nap down. The table is then ironed. Strachan cloth, used in official snooker tournaments, is 100% wool. Some other cloths include a small percentage of nylon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ILdhT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cues Cues&quot; /&gt;

After Davis retired from World Championship play, the next dominant force was his younger brother Fred Davis, who had lost the [[1940 World Snooker Championship|1940]] final to Joe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe Davis&quot;/&gt; By 1947, Fred Davis was deemed ready by his brother to take over the mantle, but lost the world final to the Scotsman [[Walter Donaldson (snooker player)|Walter Donaldson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Davis just misses world record |work=Western Daily Press |date=22 October 1947 |accessdate=18 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000513/19471022/013/0002 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and Donaldson would contest the next four finals. After the abandonment of the World Championship in 1953, with the 1952 final boycotted by British professionals, the [[World Professional Match-play Championship]] became the unofficial world championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;D80WD&quot; /&gt; Fred Davis won the event every year until its penultimate one, in 1957, which he did not enter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Chris|title=World Professional Championship|url=http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/world.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416080933/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/world.html|archivedate=16 April 2013|work=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk|publisher=Chris Turner's Snooker Archive|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pulman]] was the most successful player of the 1960s, when the [[1964–68 World Snooker Championships|world championship]] was contested on a challenge basis.&lt;ref name=GSC1964&gt;{{cite web|title=World Championship 1964|url=http://www.global-snooker.com/professional-snooker-tournaments-archive-world-championship-1964.asp|publisher=Global Snooker|accessdate=19 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310181405/http://www.global-snooker.com/professional-snooker-tournaments-archive-world-championship-1964.asp|archive-date=2011-03-10|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper.

Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985. By retaining his title in 2013, O'Sullivan became the first player to successfully defend the World Championship since Hendry in 1996 ([[Mark Selby]] would also do this in 2017).&lt;ref name=&quot;World Champions&quot; /&gt;
