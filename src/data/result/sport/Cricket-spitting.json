{"url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket-spitting", "content": "Cricket-spitting\nCricket-spitting is a sport wherein contestants place a dead cricket in their mouth, and then spit it as far as they can. The contestant who can spit the cricket the farthest is declared the winner.\nCricket-spitting was developed in 1996 by entomologist Tom Turpin at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, as a competition for their annual Bug Bowl event, which brings over 30,000 people per year to their campus for a series of insect-related events and competitions. Since its creation, other universities have begun their own competitions, such as Pennsylvania State University who have hosted their own 'spit-off' since 1998. A Scottish spin off of Cricket-Spitting is Wasp Waving, where contestants throw frozen wasps at a target while blind folded.\n\nWorld record\nThe Guinness World Record for cricket-spitting is 32\u00a0feet .5\u00a0inches (9.766\u00a0m) and is held by Dan Capps, from Madison, Wisconsin, and was set in June 1998 in front of a live television audience.  \nRobert Tony Ferrell, from Hoopeston, Illinois, held the title/record in the 1997 Bug Bowl Games until upset by Dan Capps. Unofficial records of over 38 feet have been noted at competitions.{\"citetype\": \"web\", \"url\": \"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=52688\", \"title\": \"Farthest Cricket Spit\", \"date\": \"1998-06-28\", \"publisher\": \"[[Guinness World Records]]\", \"accessdate\": \"2006-07-22\", \"archiveurl \": \"https://web.archive.org/web/20060525103343/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=52688\"}\n\nRules\nNote: The ruleset is not fixed, and is subject to change or modification by organizations hosting their own competitions.\n"}
