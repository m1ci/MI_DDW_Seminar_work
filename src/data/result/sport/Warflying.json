Warstorming shares similarities to Wardriving and Warwalking in all aspects except for the method of transport.\nIt originated in Western Australia with the WaFreeNet (WAFN) group taking up a Grumman Tiger four-seater near Perth City in 2002, as documented on the weblog of Jason Jordan\nDue to the nature of flying, it is much more difficult to attempt to access open networks while warflying.\n"}
